        "body": "This release of fish introduces the following small enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Cursor shaping for Vi mode is enabled by default in tmux, and will be used if the outer terminal is capable ([#8981](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8981)).\r\n* `printf` returns a better error when used with arguments interpreted as octal numbers ([#9035](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9035)).\r\n* `history merge` when in private mode is now an error, rather than wiping out other sessions\u2019 history ([#9050](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9050)).\r\n* The error message when launching a command that is built for the wrong architecture on macOS is more helpful ([#9052](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9052)).\r\n* Added completions for:\r\n    * `choose` ([#9065](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9065))\r\n    * `expect` ([#9060](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9060))\r\n    * `navi` ([#9064](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9064))\r\n    * `qdbus` ([#9031](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9031))\r\n    * `reflector` ([#9027](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9027))\r\n* Improvements to some completions.\r\n\r\nThis release also fixes a number of problems identified in fish 3.5.0.\r\n\r\n* Completing `git blame` or `git -C` works correctly ([#9053](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9053)).\r\n* On terminals that emit a `CSI u` sequence for `Shift-Space`, fish inserts a space instead of printing an error. ([#9054](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9054)).\r\n* `status fish-path` on Linux-based platforms could print the path with a \u201d (deleted)\u201d suffix (such as `/usr/bin/fish (deleted)`), which is now removed ([#9019](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9019)).\r\n* Cancelling an initial command (from fish\u2019s `--init-command` option) with `Control-C` no longer prevents configuration scripts from running ([#9024](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9024)).\r\n* The job summary contained extra blank lines if the prompt used multiple lines, which is now fixed ([#9044](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9044)).\r\n* Using special input functions in bindings, in combination with `and`/`or` conditionals, no longer crashes ([#9051](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9051)).\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.5.1.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `a6d45b3dc5a45dd31772e7f8dfdfecabc063986e8f67d60bd7ca60cc81db6928`. A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A`) is available as \"fish-3.5.1.tar.xz.asc\".*",

        "body": "### Notable improvements and fixes\r\n* A new `path` builtin command to filter and transform paths ([#7659](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7659), [#8958](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8958)). For example, to list all the separate extensions used on files in /usr/share/man (after removing one extension, commonly a \u201c.gz\u201d):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\npath filter -f /usr/share/man/** | path change-extension '' | path extension | path sort -u\r\n```\r\n* Tab (or any key bound to `complete`) now expands wildcards instead of invoking completions, if there is a wildcard in the path component under the cursor ([#954](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/954), [#8593](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8593)).\r\n* Scripts can now catch and handle the SIGINT and SIGTERM signals, either via `function --on-signal` or with `trap` ([#6649](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6649)).\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n* The `stderr-nocaret` feature flag, introduced in fish 3.0 and enabled by default in fish 3.1, has been made read-only.\r\nThat means it is no longer possible to disable it, and code supporting the `^` redirection has been removed ([#8857](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8857), [#8865](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8865)).\r\n\r\nTo recap: fish used to support `^` to redirect stderr, so you could use commands like:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\ntest \"$foo\" -gt 8 ^/dev/null\r\n```\r\n\r\nto ignore error messages. This made the `^` symbol require escaping and quoting, and was a bit of a weird shortcut considering `2>` already worked, which is only one character longer.\r\n\r\nSo the above can simply become:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\ntest \"$foo\" -gt 8 2>/dev/null\r\n```\r\n* The following feature flags have been enabled by default:\r\n    * `regex-easyesc`, which makes `string replace -r` not do a superfluous round of unescaping in the replacement expression.\r\nThat means e.g. to escape any \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb\u201d in an argument you can use `string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$1' foobar` instead of needing 8 backslashes.\r\n\r\nThis only affects the *replacement* expression, not the *match* expression (the `'([ab])'` part in the example).\r\nA survey of plugins on GitHub did not turn up any affected code, so we do not expect this to affect many users.\r\n\r\nThis flag was introduced in fish 3.1.\r\n    * `ampersand-nobg-in-token`, which means that `&` will not create a background job if it occurs in the middle of a word. For example, `echo foo&bar` will print \u201cfoo&bar\u201d instead of running `echo foo` in the background and then starting `bar` as a second job.\r\n\r\nReformatting with `fish_indent` would already introduce spaces, turning `echo foo&bar` into `echo foo & bar`.\r\n\r\nThis flag was introduced in fish 3.4.\r\n\r\nTo turn off these flags, add `no-regex-easyesc` or `no-ampersand-nobg-in-token` to `fish_features\\`` and restart fish:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nset -Ua fish_features no-regex-easyesc\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike `stderr-nocaret`, they will eventually be made read-only.\r\n* Most `string` subcommands no longer append a newline to their input if the input didn\u2019t have one ([#8473](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8473), [#3847](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3847))\r\n* Fish\u2019s escape sequence removal (like for `string length --visible` or to figure out how wide the prompt is) no longer has special support for non-standard color sequences like from Data General terminals, e.g. the Data General Dasher D220 from 1984. This removes a bunch of work in the common case, allowing `string length --visible` to be much faster with unknown escape sequences. We don\u2019t expect anyone to have ever used fish with such a terminal ([#8769](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8769)).\r\n* Code to upgrade universal variables from fish before 3.0 has been removed. Users who upgrade directly from fish versions 2.7.1 or before will have to set their universal variables & abbreviations again. ([#8781](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8781))\r\n* The meaning of an empty color variable has changed ([#8793](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8793)). Previously, when a variable was set but empty, it would be interpreted as the \u201cnormal\u201d color. Now, empty color variables cause the same effect as unset variables - the general highlighting variable for that type is used instead. For example:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nset -g fish_color_command blue\r\nset -g fish_color_keyword\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould previously make keywords \u201cnormal\u201d (usually white in a dark terminal). Now it\u2019ll make them blue. To achieve the previous behavior, use the normal color explicitly: `set -g fish_color_keyword normal`.\r\n\r\nThis makes it easier to make self-contained color schemes that don\u2019t accidentally use color that was set before.\r\n`fish_config` has been adjusted to set known color variables that a theme doesn\u2019t explicitly set to empty.\r\n* `eval` is now a reserved keyword, so it can\u2019t be used as a function name. This follows `set` and `read`, and is necessary because it can\u2019t be cleanly shadowed by a function - at the very least `eval set -l argv foo` breaks. Fish will ignore autoload files for it, so left over `eval.fish` from previous fish versions won\u2019t be loaded.\r\n* The git prompt in informative mode now defaults to skipping counting untracked files, as this was extremely slow. To turn it on, set `__fish_git_prompt_showuntrackedfiles` or set the git config value \u201cbash.showuntrackedfiles\u201d to `true` explicitly (which can be done for individual repositories). The \u201cinformative+vcs\u201d sample prompt already skipped display of untracked files, but didn\u2019t do so in a way that skipped the computation, so it should be quite a bit faster in many cases ([#8980](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8980)).\r\n* The `__terlar_git_prompt` function, used by the \u201cTerlar\u201d sample prompt, has been rebuilt as a configuration of the normal `fish_git_prompt` to ease maintenance, improve performance and add features (like reading per-repo git configuration). Some slight changes remain; users who absolutely must have the same behavior are encouraged to copy the old function ([#9011](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9011), [#7918](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7918), [#8979](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8979)).\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n* Quoted command substitution that directly follow a variable expansion (like `echo \"$var$(echo x)\"`) no longer affect the variable expansion ([#8849](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8849)).\r\n* Fish now correctly expands command substitutions that are preceded by an escaped dollar (like `echo \\\\$(echo)`). This regressed in version 3.4.0.\r\n* `math` can now handle underscores (`_`) as visual separators in numbers ([#8611](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8611), [#8496](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8496)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nmath 5 + 2_123_252\r\n```\r\n* `math`\u2019s `min` and `max` functions now take a variable number of arguments instead of always requiring 2 ([#8644](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8644), [#8646](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8646)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> math min 8,2,4\r\n2\r\n```\r\n* `read` is now faster as the last process in a pipeline ([#8552](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8552)).\r\n* `string join` gained a new `--no-empty` flag to skip empty arguments ([#8774](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8774), [#8351](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8351)).\r\n* `read` now only triggers the `fish_read` event, not the `fish_prompt` event ([#8797](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8797)). It was supposed to work this way in fish 3.2.0 and later, but both events were emitted.\r\n* The TTY modes are no longer restored when non-interactive shells exit. This fixes wrong tty modes in pipelines with interactive commands. ([#8705](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8705)).\r\n* Some functions shipped with fish printed error messages to standard output, but they now they rightly go to standard error ([#8855](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8855)).\r\n* `jobs` now correctly reports CPU usage as a percentage, instead of as a number of clock ticks ([#8919](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8919)).\r\n* `process-exit` events now fire when the process exits even if the job has not yet exited, fixing a regression in 3.4.1 ([#8914](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8914)).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n* Fish now reports a special error if a command wasn\u2019t found and there is a non-executable file by that name in [`PATH`](language.md#envvar-PATH) ([#8804](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8804)).\r\n* `less` and other interactive commands would occasionally be stopped when run in a pipeline with fish functions; this has been fixed ([#8699](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8699)).\r\n* Case-changing autosuggestions generated mid-token now correctly append only the suffix, instead of duplicating the token ([#8820](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8820)).\r\n* `ulimit` learned a number of new options for the resource limits available on Linux, FreeBSD ande NetBSD, and returns a specific warning if the limit specified is not available on the active operating system ([#8823](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8823), [#8786](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8786)).\r\n* The `vared` command can now successfully edit variables named \u201ctmp\u201d or \u201cprompt\u201d ([#8836](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8836), [#8837](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8837)).\r\n* `time` now emits an error if used after the first command in a pipeline ([#8841](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8841)).\r\n* `fish_add_path` now prints a message for skipped non-existent paths when using the `-v` flag ([#8884](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8884)).\r\n* Since fish 3.2.0, pressing `Control-D` while a command is running would end up inserting a space into the next commandline, which has been fixed ([#8871](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8871)).\r\n* A bug that caused multi-line prompts to be moved down a line when pasting or switching modes has been fixed ([#3481](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3481)).\r\n* The Web-based configuration system no longer strips too many quotes in the abbreviation display ([#8917](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8917), [#8918](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8918)).\r\n* Fish started with `--no-config` will now use the default keybindings ([#8493](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8493))\r\n* When fish inherits a [`USER`](language.md#envvar-USER) environment variable value that doesn\u2019t correspond to the current effective user ID, it will now correct it in all cases ([#8879](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8879), [#8583](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8583)).\r\n* Fish sets a new `EUID` variable containing the current effective user id ([#8866](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8866)).\r\n* `history search` no longer interprets the search term as an option ([#8853](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8853))\r\n* The status message when a job terminates should no longer be erased by a multiline prompt ([#8817](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8817))\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n* The `Alt-S` binding will now insert `doas` instead of `sudo` if necessary ([#8942](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8942)).\r\n* The `kill-whole-line` special input function now kills the newline preceeding the last line. This makes `dd` in vi-mode clear the last line properly.\r\n* The new `kill-inner-line` special input function kills the line without any newlines, allowing `cc` in vi-mode to clear the line while preserving newlines ([#8983](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8983)).\r\n* On terminals that emit special sequences for these combinations, `Shift-Space` is bound like `Space`, and `Ctrl-Return` is bound like `Return` ([#8874](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8874)).\r\n\r\n#### Improved prompts\r\n* A new `Astronaut` prompt ([#8775](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8775)), a multi-line prompt using plain text reminiscent of the Starship.rs prompt.\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n* Added completions for:\r\n    * `archlinux-java` ([#8911](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8911))\r\n    * `apk` ([#8951](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8951))\r\n    * `brightnessctl` ([#8758](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8758))\r\n    * `efibootmgr` ([#9010](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9010))\r\n    * `fastboot` ([#8904](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8904))\r\n    * `optimus-manager` ([#8913](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8913))\r\n    * `rclone` ([#8819](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8819))\r\n    * `sops` ([#8821](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8821))\r\n    * `tuned-adm` ([#8760](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8760))\r\n    * `wg-quick` ([#8687](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8687))\r\n* `complete` can now be given multiple `--condition` options. They will be attempted in the order they were given, and only if all succeed will the completion be made available (as if they were connected with `&&`). This helps with caching - fish\u2019s complete system stores the return value of each condition as long as the commandline doesn\u2019t change, so this can reduce the number of conditions that need to be evaluated ([#8536](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8536), [#8967](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8967)).\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal support\r\n* Working directory reporting is enabled for kitty ([#8806](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8806)).\r\n* Changing the cursor shape is now enabled by default in iTerm2 ([#3696](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3696)).\r\n\r\n### For distributors\r\n* libatomic is now correctly detected as necessary when building on RISC-V ([#8850](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8850), [#8851](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8851)).\r\n* In some cases, the build process found the wrong libintl on macOS. This has been corrected ([#5244](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5244)).\r\n* The paths for completions, functions, and configuration snippets now include\r\nsubdirectories `fish/vendor_completions.d`, `fish/vendor_functions.d`, and\r\n`fish/vendor_conf.d` (respectively) within `XDG_DATA_HOME` (or `~/.local/share`\r\nif not defined) ([#8887](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8887), [#7816](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7816)).\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.5.0.tar.xz\".

This has been corrected ([#8790](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8790)).\r\n* `funcsave -q` and `funcsave --quiet` now work correctly ([#8830](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8830)).\r\n* Issues with the `csharp` and `nmcli` completions were corrected.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 3.3.1 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.4.0 (included below).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, use the file named \"fish-3.4.1.tar.xz\".

        "body": "### Notable improvements and fixes\r\n\r\n* fish\u2019s command substitution syntax has been extended: `$(cmd)` now has the same meaning as `(cmd)` but it can be used inside double quotes, to prevent line splitting of the results ([#159](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/159)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nfoo (bar | string collect)\r\n# can now be written as\r\nfoo \"$(bar)\"\r\n\r\n# and\r\n\r\nfoo (bar)\r\n# can now be written as\r\nfoo $(bar)\r\n# this will still split on newlines only.\r\n```\r\n* Complementing the `prompt` command in 3.3.0, `fish_config` gained a `theme` subcommand to show and pick from the sample themes (meaning color schemes) directly in the terminal, instead of having to open a Web browser. For example `fish_config theme choose Nord` loads the Nord theme in the current session ([#8132](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8132)). The current theme can be saved with `fish_config theme dump`, and custom themes can be added by saving them in `~/.config/fish/themes/`.\r\n* `set` and `read` learned a new option, `--function`, to set a variable in the function\u2019s top scope. This should be a more familiar way of scoping variables and avoids issues with `--local`, which is actually block-scoped ([#565](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/565), [#8145](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8145)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\nfunction demonstration\r\n    if true\r\n        set --function foo bar\r\n        set --local baz banana\r\n    end\r\n    echo $foo # prints \"bar\" because $foo is still valid\r\n    echo $baz # prints nothing because $baz went out of scope\r\nend\r\n```\r\n* `string pad` now excludes escape sequences like colors that fish knows about, and a new `--visible` flag to `string length` makes it use that kind of visible width. This is useful to get the number of terminal cells an already colored string would occupy, like in a prompt. ([#8182](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8182), [#7784](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7784), [#4012](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4012)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> string length --visible (set_color red)foo\r\n3\r\n```\r\n* Performance improvements to globbing, especially on systems using glibc. In some cases (large directories with files with many numbers in the names) this almost halves the time taken to expand the glob.\r\n* Autosuggestions can now be turned off by setting `$fish_autosuggestion_enabled` to 0, and (almost) all highlighting can be turned off by choosing the new \u201cNone\u201d theme. The exception is necessary colors, like those which distinguish autosuggestions from the actual command line. ([#8376](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8376))\r\n* The `fish_git_prompt` function, which is included in the default prompts, now overrides `git` to avoid running  commands set by per-repository configuration. This avoids a potential security issue in some circumstances, and has been assigned CVE-2022-20001 ([#8589](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8589)).\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n\r\n* A new feature flag, `ampersand-nobg-in-token` makes `&` only act as background operator if followed by a separator. In combination with `qmark-noglob`, this allows entering most URLs at the command line without quoting or escaping ([#7991](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7991)). For example:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> echo foo&bar # will print \"foo&bar\", instead of running \"echo foo\" in the background and executing \"bar\"\r\n> echo foo & bar # will still run \"echo foo\" in the background and then run \"bar\"\r\n# with both ampersand-nobg-in-token and qmark-noglob, this argument has no special characters anymore\r\n> open https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&feature=youtu.be\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, feature flags can be set on startup with `fish --features ampersand-nobg-in-token,qmark-noglob` or with a universal variable called `fish_features`:\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> set -Ua fish_features ampersand-nobg-in-token\r\n```\r\n* `$status` is now forbidden as a command, to prevent a surprisingly common error among new users: Running `if $status` ([#8171](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8171)). This applies *only* to `$status`, other variables are still allowed.\r\n* `set --query` now returns an exit status of 255 if given no variable names. This means `if set -q $foo` will not enter the if-block if `$foo` is empty or unset. To restore the previous behavior, use `if not set -q foo; or set -q $foo` - but this is unlikely to be desireable ([#8214](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8214)).\r\n* `_` is now a reserved keyword ([#8342](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8342)).\r\n* The special input functions `delete-or-exit`, `nextd-or-forward-word` and `prevd-or-backward-word` replace fish functions of the same names ([#8538](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8538)).\r\n* Mac OS X 10.9 is no longer supported. The minimum Mac version is now 10.10 \u201cYosemite.\u201d\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n\r\n* `string collect` supports a new `--allow-empty` option, which will output one empty argument in a command substitution that has no output ([#8054](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8054)). This allows commands like `test -n (echo -n | string collect --allow-empty)` to work more reliably. Note this can also be written as `test -n \"$(echo -n)\"` (see above).\r\n* `string match` gained a `--groups-only` option, which makes it only output capturing groups, excluding the full match. This allows `string match` to do simple transformations ([#6056](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6056)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> string match -r --groups-only '(.*)fish' 'catfish' 'twofish' 'blue fish' | string escape\r\ncat\r\ntwo\r\n'blue '\r\n```\r\n* `$fish_user_paths` is now automatically deduplicated to fix a common user error of appending to it in config.fish when it is universal ([#8117](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8117)). [fish_add_path](cmds/fish_add_path.md#cmd-fish-add-path) remains the recommended way to add to $PATH.\r\n* `return` can now be used outside functions. In scripts, it does the same thing as `exit`. In interactive mode,it sets `$status` without exiting ([#8148](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8148)).\r\n* An oversight prevented all syntax checks from running on commands given to `fish -c` ([#8171](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8171)). This includes checks such as `exec` not being allowed in a pipeline, and `$$` not being a valid variable. Generally, another error was generated anyway.\r\n* `fish_indent` now correctly reformats tokens that end with a backslash followed by a newline ([#8197](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8197)).\r\n* `commandline` gained an `--is-valid` option to check if the command line is syntactically valid and complete. This allows basic implementation of transient prompts ([#8142](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8142)).\r\n* `commandline` gained a `--paging-full-mode` option to check if the pager is showing all the possible lines (no \u201c7 more rows\u201d message) ([#8485](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8485)).\r\n* List expansion correctly reports an error when used with all zero indexes ([#8213](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8213)).\r\n* Running `fish` with a directory instead of a script as argument (eg `fish .`) no longer leads to an infinite loop. Instead it errors out immediately ([#8258](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8258))\r\n* Some error messages occuring after fork, like \u201ctext file busy\u201d have been replaced by bespoke error messages for fish (like \u201cFile is currently open for writing\u201d). This also restores error messages with current glibc versions that removed sys_errlist ([#8234](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8234), [#4183](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4183)).\r\n* The `realpath` builtin now also squashes leading slashes with the `--no-symlinks` option ([#8281](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8281)).\r\n* When trying to `cd` to a dangling (broken) symbolic link, fish will print an error noting that the target is a broken link ([#8264](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8264)).\r\n* On MacOS terminals that are not granted permissions to access a folder, `cd` would print a spurious \u201crotten symlink\u201d error, which has been corrected to \u201cpermission denied\u201d ([#8264](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8264)).\r\n* Since fish 3.0, `for` loops would trigger a variable handler function before the loop was entered. As the variable had not actually changed or been set, this was a spurious event and has been removed ([#8384](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8384)).\r\n* `math` now correctly prints negative values and values larger than `2\\*\\*31` when in hex or octal bases ([#8417](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8417)).\r\n* `dirs` always produces an exit status of 0, instead of sometimes returning 1 ([#8211](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8211)).\r\n* `cd \"\"` no longer crashes fish ([#8147](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8147)).\r\n* `set --query` can now query whether a variable is a path variable via `--path` or `--unpath` ([#8494](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8494)).\r\n* Tilde characters (`~`) produced by custom completions are no longer escaped when applied to the command line, making it easier to use the output of a recursive `complete -C` in completion scripts ([#4570](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4570)).\r\n* `set --show` reports when a variable is read-only ([#8179](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8179)).\r\n* Erasing `$fish_emoji_width` will reset fish to the default guessed emoji width ([#8274](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8274)).\r\n* The `la` function no longer lists entries for \u201c.\u201d and \u201c..\u201d, matching other systems defaults ([#8519](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8519)).\r\n* `abbr -q` returns the correct exit status when given multiple abbreviation names as arguments ([#8431](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8431)).\r\n* `command -v` returns an exit status of 127 instead of 1 if no command was found ([#8547](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8547)).\r\n* `argparse` with `--ignore-unknown` no longer breaks with multiple unknown options in a short option group ([#8637](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8637)).\r\n* Comments inside command substitutions or brackets now correctly ignore parentheses, quotes, and brackets ([#7866](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7866), [#8022](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8022), [#8695](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8695)).\r\n* `complete -C` supports a new `--escape` option, which turns on escaping in returned completion strings ([#3469](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3469)).\r\n* Invalid byte or unicode escapes like `\\\\Utest` or `\\\\xNotHex` are now a tokenizer error instead of causing the token to be truncated ([#8545](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8545)).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n\r\n* Vi mode cursors are now set properly after `Control-C` ([#8125](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8125)).\r\n* `funced` will try to edit the whole file containing a function definition, if there is one ([#391](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/391)).\r\n* Running a command line consisting of just spaces now deletes an ephemeral (starting with space) history item again ([#8232](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8232)).\r\n* Command substitutions no longer respect job control, instead running inside fish\u2019s own process group ([#8172](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8172)). This more closely matches other shells, and improves `Control-C` reliability inside a command substitution.\r\n* `history` and `__fish_print_help` now properly support `less` before version 530, including the version that ships with macOS. ([#8157](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8157)).\r\n* `help` now knows which section is in which document again ([#8245](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8245)).\r\n* fish\u2019s highlighter will now color options (starting with `-` or `--`) with the color given in the new $fish_color_option, up to the first `--`. It falls back on $fish_color_param, so nothing changes for existing setups ([#8292](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8292)).\r\n* When executing a command, abbreviations are no longer expanded when the cursor is separated from the command by spaces, making it easier to suppress abbreviation expansion of commands without arguments. ([#8423](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8423)).\r\n* `fish_key_reader`\u2019s output was simplified. By default, it now only prints a bind statement. The previous per-character timing information can be seen with a new `--verbose` switch ([#8467](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8467)).\r\n* Custom completions are now also loaded for commands that contain tildes or variables like `~/bin/fish` or `$PWD/fish` ([#8442](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8442)).\r\n* Command lines spanning multiple lines will not be overwritten by the completion pager when it fills the entire terminal ([#8509](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8509), [#8405](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8405)).\r\n* When redrawing a multiline prompt, the old prompt is now properly cleared ([#8163](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8163)).\r\n* Interactive completion would occasionally ignore the last word on the command line due to a race condition. This has been fixed ([#8175](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8175)).\r\n* Propagation of universal variables from a fish process that is closing is faster ([#8209](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8209)).\r\n* The command line is drawn in the correct place if the prompt ends with a newline ([#8298](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8298)).\r\n* `history` learned a new subcommand `clear-session` to erase all history from the current session ([#5791](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5791)).\r\n* Pressing `Control-C` in `fish_key_reader` will no longer print the incorrect \u201cPress [ctrl-C] again to exit\u201d message ([#8510](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8510)).\r\n* The default command-not-found handler for Fedora/PackageKit now passes the whole command line, allowing for functionality such as running the suggested command directly ([#8579](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8579)).\r\n* When looking for locale information, the Debian configuration is now used when available ([#8557](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8557)).\r\n* Pasting text containing quotes from the clipboard trims spaces more appropriately ([#8550](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8550)).\r\n* The clipboard bindings ignore X-based clipboard programs if the `DISPLAY` environment variable is not set, which helps prefer the Windows clipboard when it is available (such as on WSL).\r\n* `funcsave` will remove a saved copy of a function that has been erased with `functions --erase`.\r\n* The Web-based configuration tool gained a number of improvements, including the ability to set pager colors.\r\n* The default `fish_title` prints a shorter title with shortened $PWD and no more redundant \u201cfish\u201d ([#8641](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8641)).\r\n* Holding down an arrow key won\u2019t freeze the terminal with long periods of flashing ([#8610](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8610)).\r\n* Multi-char bindings are no longer interrupted if a signal handler enqueues an event. ([#8628](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8628)).\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n\r\n* `Escape` can now bound without breaking arrow key bindings ([#8428](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8428)).\r\n* The `Alt-H` binding (to open a command\u2019s manual page) now also ignores `command` ([#8447](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8447)).\r\n\r\n#### Improved prompts\r\n\r\n* The `fish_status_to_signal` helper function returns the correct signal names for the current platform, rather than Linux ([#8530](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8530)).\r\n* The `prompt_pwd` helper function learned a `--full-length-dirs N` option to keep the last N directory components unshortened. In addition the number of characters to shorten each component should be shortened to can now be given as `-d N` or `--dir-length N`. ([#8208](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8208)):\r\n\r\n```fish\r\n> prompt_pwd --full-length-dirs 2 -d 1 ~/dev/fish-shell/share/tools/web_config\r\n~/d/f/s/tools/web_config\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n\r\n* Added completions for:\r\n    * Apple\u2019s `shortcuts`\r\n    * `argparse` ([#8434](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8434))\r\n    * `asd` ([#8759](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8759))\r\n    * `az` ([#8141](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8141))\r\n    * `black` ([#8123](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8123))\r\n    * `clasp` ([#8373](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8373))\r\n    * `cpupower` ([#8302](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8302))\r\n    * `dart` ([#8315](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8315))\r\n    * `dscacheutil`\r\n    * `elvish` ([#8416](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8416))\r\n    * `ethtool` ([#8283](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8283))\r\n    * `exif` ([#8246](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8246))\r\n    * `findstr` ([#8481](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8481))\r\n    * `git-sizer` ([#8156](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8156))\r\n    * `gnome-extensions` ([#8732](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8732))\r\n    * `gping` ([#8181](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8181))\r\n    * `isatty` ([#8609](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8609))\r\n    * `istioctl` ([#8343](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8343))\r\n    * `kmutil`\r\n    * `kubectl` ([#8734](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8734))\r\n    * `matlab` ([#8505](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8505))\r\n    * `mono` ([#8415](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8415)) and related tools `csharp`, `gacutil`, `gendarme`, `ikdasm`, `ilasm`, `mkbundle`, `monodis`, `monop`, `sqlsharp` and `xsp` ([#8452](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8452))\r\n    * Angular\u2019s `ng` ([#8111](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8111))\r\n    * `nodeenv` ([#8533](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8533))\r\n    * `octave` ([#8505](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8505))\r\n    * `pabcnet_clear` ([#8421](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8421))\r\n    * `qmk` ([#8180](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8180))\r\n    * `rakudo` ([#8113](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8113))\r\n    * `rc-status` ([#8757](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8757))\r\n    * `roswell` ([#8330](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8330))\r\n    * `sbcl` ([#8330](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8330))\r\n    * `starship` ([#8520](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8520))\r\n    * `topgrade` ([#8651](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8651))\r\n    * `wine`, `wineboot` and `winemaker` ([#8411](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8411))\r\n    * Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\u2019s `wslpath` ([#8364](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8364))\r\n    * Windows\u2019 `color` ([#8483](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8483)), `attrib`, `attributes`, `choice`, `clean`, `cleanmgr`, `cmd`, `cmdkey`, `comp`, `forfiles`, `powershell`, `reg`, `schtasks`, `setx` ([#8486](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8486))\r\n    * `zef` ([#8114](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8114))\r\n* Improvements to many completions, especially for `git` aliases ([#8129](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8129)), subcommands ([#8134](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8134)) and submodules ([#8716](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8716)).\r\n* Many adjustments to complete correct options for system utilities on BSD and macOS.\r\n* When evaluating custom completions, the command line state no longer includes variable overrides (`var=val`). This unbreaks completions that read `commandline -op`.\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal support\r\n\r\n* Dynamic terminal titles are enabled on WezTerm ([#8121](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8121)).\r\n* Directory history navigation works out of the box with Apple Terminal\u2019s default key settings ([#2330](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2330)).\r\n* fish now assumes Unicode 9+ widths for emoji under iTerm 2 ([#8200](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8200)).\r\n* Skin-tone emoji modifiers (U+1F3FB through U+1F3FF) are now measured as width 0 ([#8275](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8275)).\r\n* fish\u2019s escape sequence removal now also knows Tmux\u2019s wrapped escapes.\r\n* Vi mode cursors are enabled in Apple Terminal.app ([#8167](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8167)).\r\n* Vi cursor shaping and $PWD reporting is now also enabled on foot ([#8422](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8422)).\r\n* `ls` will use colors also on newer versions of Apple Terminal.app ([#8309](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8309)).\r\n* The `Delete` and `Shift-Tab` keys work more reliably under `st` ([#8352](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8352), [#8354](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8354)).\r\n\r\n### Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Fish\u2019s test suite now uses `ctest`, and has become much faster to run. It is now also possible to run only specific tests with targets named `test_$filename` - `make test_set.fish` only runs the set.fish test. ([#7851](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7851))\r\n* The HTML version of the documentation now includes copy buttons for code examples ([#8218](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8218)).\r\n* The HTML version of the documentation and the web-based configuration tool now pick more modern system fonts instead of falling back to Arial and something like Courier New most of the time ([#8632](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8632)).\r\n* The Debian & Ubuntu package linked from fishshell.com is now a single package, rather than split into `fish` and `fish-common` ([#7845](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7845)).\r\n* The macOS installer does not assert that Rosetta is required to install fish on machines with Apple Silicon ([#8566](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8566)).\r\n* The macOS installer now cleans up previous .pkg installations when upgrading. ([#2963](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2963)).\r\n\r\n### For distributors\r\n\r\n* The minimum version of CMake required to build fish is now 3.5.0.\r\n* The CMake installation supports absolute paths for `CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR` ([#8150](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8150)).\r\n* Building using NetBSD curses works on any platform ([#8087](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8087)).\r\n* The build system now uses the default linker instead of forcing use of the gold or lld linker ([#8152](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8152)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, use the file named \"fish-3.4.0.tar.xz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" has extra build requirements. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `b5b48ab8486b19ef716a32f7f46b88b9ea5356155f0e967ee99f4093645413c5`. A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A`) is available as \"fish-3.4.0.tar.xz.asc\".*",

        "body": "## Notable improvements and fixes\r\n\r\n* `fish_config` gained a `prompt` subcommand to show and pick from the sample prompts directly in the terminal, instead of having to open a webbrowser. For example `fish_config prompt choose default` loads the default prompt in the current session ([#7958](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7958)).\r\n* The documentation has been reorganized to be easier to understand ([#7773](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7773)).\r\n\r\n## Deprecations and removed features\r\n\r\n* The `$fish_history` value \"default\" is no longer special. It used to be treated the same as \"fish\" ([#7650](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7650)).\r\n* Redirection to standard error with the `^` character has been disabled by default. It can be turned back on using the `stderr-nocaret` feature flag, but will eventually be disabled completely ([#7105](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7105)).\r\n* Specifying an initial tab to `fish_config` now only works with `fish_config browse` (e.g. `fish_config browse variables`), otherwise it would interfere with the new `prompt` subcommand (see below) ([#7958](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7958)).\r\n\r\n## Scripting improvements\r\n\r\n* `math` gained new functions `log2` (like the documentation claimed), `max` and `min` ([#7856](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7856)). `math` functions can be used without the parentheses (eg `math sin 2 + 6`), and functions have the lowest precedence in the order of operations ([#7877](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7877)).\r\n* Shebang (`#!`) lines are no longer required within shell scripts, improving support for scripts with concatenated binary contents. If a file fails to execute and passes a (rudimentary) binary safety check, fish will re-invoke it using `/bin/sh` ([#7802](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7802)).\r\n* Exit codes are better aligned with bash. A failed execution now reports `$status` of 127 if the file is not found, and 126 if it is not executable.\r\n* `echo` no longer writes its output one byte at a time, improving performance and allowing use with Linux's special API files (`/proc`, `/sys` and such) ([#7836](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7836)).\r\n* fish should now better handle `cd` on filesystems with broken `stat(3)` responses ([#7577](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7577)).\r\n* Builtins now properly report a `$status` of 1 upon unsuccessful writes ([#7857](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7857)).\r\n* `string match` with unmatched capture groups and without the `--all` flag now sets an empty variable instead of a variable containing the empty string. It also correctly imports the first match if multiple arguments are provided, matching the documentation. ([#7938](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7938)).\r\n* fish produces more specific errors when a command in a command substitution wasn't found or is not allowed. This now prints something like \"Unknown command\" instead of \"Unknown error while evaluating command substitution\".\r\n* `fish_indent` allows inline variable assignments (`FOO=BAR command`) to use line continuation, instead of joining them into one line ([#7955](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7955)).\r\n* fish gained a `--no-config` option to disable configuration files. This applies to user-specific and the systemwide `config.fish` (typically in `/etc/fish/config.fish`), and configuration snippets (typically in `conf.d` directories). It also disables universal variables, history, and loading of functions from system or user configuration directories ([#7921](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7921), [#1256](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1256)).\r\n* When universal variables are unavailable for some reason, setting a universal variable now sets a global variable instead ([#7921](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7921)).\r\n* `$last_pid` now contains the process ID of the last process in the pipeline, allowing it to be used in scripts ([#5036](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5036), [#5832](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5832), [#7721](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7721)). Previously, this value contained the process group ID, but in scripts this was the same as the running fish's process ID.\r\n* `process-exit` event handlers now receive the same value as `$status` in all cases, instead of receiving -1 when the exit was due to a signal.\r\n* `process-exit` event handlers for PID 0 also received `JOB_EXIT` events; this has been fixed.\r\n* `job-exit` event handlers may now be created with any of the PIDs from the job. The handler is passed the last PID in the job as its second argument, instead of the process group.\r\n* Trying to set an empty variable name with `set` no longer works (these variables could not be used in expansions anyway).\r\n* `fish_add_path` handles an undefined `PATH` environment variable correctly ([#8082](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8082)).\r\n\r\n## Interactive improvements\r\n\r\n* Commands entered before the previous command finishes will now be properly syntax highlighted.\r\n* fish now automatically creates `config.fish` and the configuration directories in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish` (by default `~/.config/fish`) if they do not already exist ([#7402](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7402)).\r\n* `$SHLVL` is no longer incremented in non-interactive shells. This means it won't be set to values larger than 1 just because your environment happens to run some scripts in $SHELL in its startup path ([#7864](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7864)).\r\n* fish no longer rings the bell when flashing the command line. The flashing should already be enough notification and the bell can be annoying ([#7875](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7875)).\r\n* `fish --help` is more helpful if the documentation isn't installed ([#7824](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7824)).\r\n* `funced` won't include an entry on where a function is defined, thanks to the new `functions --no-details` option ([#7879](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7879)).\r\n* A new variable, `fish_killring`, containing entries from the killring, is now available ([#7445](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7445)).\r\n* `fish --private` prints a note on private mode on startup even if `$fish_greeting` is an empty list ([#7974](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7974)).\r\n* fish no longer attempts to lock history or universal variable files on remote filesystems, including NFS and Samba mounts. In rare cases, updates to these files may be dropped if separate fish instances modify them simultaneously. ([#7968](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7968)).\r\n* `wait` and `on-process-exit` work correctly with jobs that have already exited ([#7210](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7210)).\r\n* `__fish_print_help` (used for `--help` output for fish's builtins) now respects the `LESS` environment variable, and if not set, uses better default pager settings ([#7997](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7997)).\r\n* Errors from `alias` are now printed to standard error, matching other builtins and functions ([#7925](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7925)).\r\n* `ls` output is colorized on OpenBSD if colorls utility is installed ([#8035](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8035))\r\n* The default pager color looks better in terminals with light backgrounds ([#3412](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3412)).\r\n* Further robustness improvements to the bash history import ([#7874](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7874)).\r\n* fish now tries to find a Unicode-aware locale for encoding (`LC_CTYPE`) if started without any locale information, improving the display of emoji and other non-ASCII text on misconfigured systems ([#8031](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8031)). To allow a C locale, set the variable `fish_allow_singlebyte_locale` to 1.\r\n* The Web-based configuration and documentation now feature a dark mode if the browser requests it ([#8043](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8043)).\r\n* Color variables can now also be given like `--background red` and `-b red`, not just `--background=red` ([#8053](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8053)).\r\n* `exit` run within `fish_prompt` now exits properly ([#8033](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8033)).\r\n* When attempting to execute the unsupported POSIX-style brace command group (`{ ... }`) fish will suggest its equivalent `begin; ...; end` commands ([#6415](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6415)).\r\n\r\n### New or improved bindings\r\n\r\n* Pasting in Vi mode puts text in the right place in normal mode ([#7847](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7847)).\r\n* Vi mode's `u` is bound to `undo` instead of `history-search-backward`, following GNU readline's behavior. Similarly, `Control-R` is bound to `redo` instead of `history-search-backward`, following Vim ([#7908](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7908)).\r\n* `s` in Vi visual mode now does the same thing as `c` ([#8039](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8039)).\r\n* The binding for `\"\\*y` now uses `fish_clipboard_copy`, allowing it to support more than just `xsel`.\r\n* The `Control-Space` binding can be correctly customised ([#7922](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7922)).\r\n* `exit` works correctly in bindings ([#7967](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7967)).\r\n* The `F1` binding, which opens the manual page for the current command, now works around a bug in certain `less` versions that fail to clear the screen ([#7863](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7863)).\r\n* The binding for `Alt-S` now toggles whether `sudo` is prepended, even when it took the commandline from history instead of only adding it.\r\n* The new functions `fish_commandline_prepend` and `fish_commandline_append` allow toggling the presence of a prefix/suffix on the current commandline. ([#7905](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7905)).\r\n* `backward-kill-path-component` `Control-W`) no longer erases parts of two tokens when the cursor is positioned immediately after `/`. ([#6258](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6258)).\r\n\r\n### Improved prompts\r\n\r\n* The default Vi mode prompt now uses foreground instead of background colors, making it less obtrusive ([#7880](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7880)).\r\n* Performance of the \"informative\" git prompt is improved somewhat ([#7871](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7871)). This is still slower than the non-informative version by its very nature. In particular it is IO-bound, so it will be very slow on slow disks or network mounts.\r\n* The sample prompts were updated. Some duplicated prompts, like the various classic variants, or less useful ones, like the \"justadollar\" prompt were removed, some prompts were cleaned up, and in some cases renamed. A new \"simple\" and \"disco\" prompt were added ([#7884](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7884), [#7897](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7897), [#7930](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7930)). The new prompts will only take effect when selected and existing installed prompts will remain unchanged.\r\n* A new `prompt_login` helper function to describe the kind of \"login\" (user, host and chroot status) for use in prompts. This replaces the old \"debian chroot\" prompt and has been added to the default and terlar prompts ([#7932](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7932)).\r\n* The Web-based configuration's prompt picker now shows and installs right prompts ([#7930](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7930)).\r\n* The git prompt now has the same symbol order in normal and \"informative\" mode, and it's customizable via `$__fish_git_prompt_status_order` ([#7926](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7926)).\r\n\r\n### Completions\r\n\r\n* Added completions for:\r\n    * `firewall-cmd` ([#7900](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7900))\r\n    * `sv` ([#8069](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8069))\r\n* Improvements to plenty of completions!\r\n* Commands that wrap `cd` (using `complete --wraps cd`) get the same completions as `cd` ([#4693](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4693)).\r\n* The `--force-files` option to `complete` works for bare arguments, not just options ([#7920](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7920)).\r\n* Completion descriptions for functions don't include the function definition, making them more concise ([#7911](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7911)).\r\n* The `kill` completions no longer error on MSYS2 ([#8046](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8046)).\r\n* Completion scripts are now loaded when calling a command via a relative path (like `./git`) ([#6001](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6001), [#7992](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7992)).\r\n* When there are multiple completion candidates, fish inserts their shared prefix. This prefix was computed in a case-insensitive way, resulting in wrong case in the completion pager. This was fixed by only inserting prefixes with matching case ([#7744](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7744)).\r\n\r\n### Improved terminal support\r\n\r\n* fish no longer tries to detect a missing new line during startup, preventing an erroneous `\u23ce` from appearing if the terminal is resized at the wrong time, which can happen in tiling window managers ([#7893](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7893)).\r\n* fish behaves better when it disagrees with the terminal on the width of characters. In particular, staircase effects with right prompts should be gone in most cases ([#8011](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8011)).\r\n* If the prompt takes up the entire line, the last character should no longer be chopped off in certain terminals ([#8002](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8002)).\r\n* fish's reflow handling has been disabled by default for kitty ([#7961](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7961)).\r\n* The default prompt no longer produces errors when used with a dumb terminal ([#7904](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7904)).\r\n* Terminal size variables are updated for window size change signal handlers (`SIGWINCH`).\r\n* Pasting within a multi-line command using a terminal that supports bracketed paste works correctly, instead of producing an error ([#7782](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7782)).\r\n* `set_color` produces an error when used with invalid arguments, rather than empty output which interacts badly with Cartesian product expansion.\r\n\r\n## For distributors\r\n\r\n* fish runs correctly on platforms without the `O_CLOEXEC` flag for `open(2)` ([#8023](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8023)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, use the file named \"fish-3.3.0.tar.xz\".

The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `5944da1a8893d11b0828a4fd9136ee174549daffb3d0adfdd8917856fe6b4009`.

        "body": "This release of fish fixes the following problems identified in fish 3.2.0:\r\n\r\n* Commands in key bindings are run with fish's internal terminal modes, instead of the terminal modes typically used for commands. This fixes a bug introduced in 3.2.0, where text would unexpectedly appear on the terminal, especially when pasting ([#7770](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7770)).\r\n* Prompts which use the internal `__fish_print_pipestatus` function will display correctly rather than carrying certain modifiers (such as bold) further than intended ([#7771](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7771)).\r\n* Redirections to internal file descriptors is allowed again, reversing the changes in 3.2.0. This fixes a problem with Midnight Commander ([#7769](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7769)).\r\n* Universal variables should be fully reliable regardless of operating system again ([#7774](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7774)).\r\n* `fish_git_prompt` no longer causes screen flickering in certain terminals ([#7775](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7775)).\r\n* `fish_add_path` manipulates the `fish_user_paths` variable correctly when moving multiple paths ([#7776](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7776)).\r\n* Pasting with a multi-line command no longer causes a `__fish_tokenizer_state` error ([#7782](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7782)).\r\n* `psub` inside event handlers cleans up temporary files properly ([#7792](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7792)).\r\n* Event handlers declared with `--on-job-exit $fish_pid` no longer run constantly ([#7721](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7721)), although these functions should use `--on-event fish_exit` instead.\r\n* Changing terminal modes inside `config.fish` works ([#7783](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7783)).\r\n* `set_color --print-colors` no longer prints all colors in bold ([#7805](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7805))\r\n* Completing commands starting with a `-` no longer prints an error ([#7809](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7809)).\r\n* Running `fish_command_not_found` directly no longer produces an error on macOS or other OSes which do not have a handler available ([#7777](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7777)).\r\n* The new `type` builtin now has the (deprecated) `--quiet` long form of `-q` ([#7766](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7766)).\r\n\r\nIt also includes some small enhancements:\r\n\r\n* `help` and `fish_config` work correctly when fish is running in a Chrome OS Crostini Linux VM ([#7789](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7789)).\r\n* The history file can be made a symbolic link without it being overwritten ([#7754](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7754)), matching a similar improvement for the universal variable file in 3.2.0.\r\n* An unhelpful error (\"access: No error\"), seen on Cygwin, is no longer produced ([#7785](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7785)).\r\n* Improvements to the `rsync` completions ([#7763](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7763)), some completion descriptions ([#7788](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7788)), and completions that use IP address ([#7787](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7787)).\r\n* Improvements to the appearance of `fish_config` ([#7811](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7811)).\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 3.1.2 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.2.0 (included below).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDownload links: To download the source code for fish, use the file named \"fish-3.2.1.tar.xz\".

        "body": "### Notable improvements and fixes\r\n* **Undo and redo support** for the command-line editor and pager search ([#1367](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1367)). By default, undo is bound to Control+Z, and redo to Alt+/.\r\n* **Builtins can now output before all data is read**. For example, `string replace` no longer has to read all of stdin before it can begin to output. This makes it usable also for pipes where the previous command hasn't finished yet, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Show all dmesg lines related to \"usb\"\r\ndmesg -w | string match '*usb*'\r\n```\r\n* **Prompts will now be truncated** instead of replaced with `\"> \"` if they are wider than the terminal ([#904](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/904)). For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/dev/build/fish-shell-git/src/fish-shell/build (makepkg)>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill turn into:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u2026h-shell/build (makepkg)>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to react to the `COLUMNS` variable inside the prompt to implement smarter behavior.\r\n* **fish completes ambiguous completions** after pressing `Tab` even when they have a common prefix, without the user having to press `Tab` again ([#6924](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6924)).\r\n* fish is less aggressive about resetting terminal modes, such as flow control, after every command. Although flow control remains off by default, enterprising users can now enable it with `stty` ([#2315](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2315), [#7704](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7704)).\r\n* A new **\"fish_add_path\" helper function to add paths to $PATH** without producing duplicates, to be used interactively or in `config.fish` ([#6960](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6960), [#7028](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7028)). For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfish_add_path /opt/mycoolthing/bin\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill add /opt/mycoolthing/bin to the beginning of $fish_user_path without creating duplicates, so it can be called safely from config.fish or interactively, and the path will just be there, once.\r\n* **Better errors with \"test\"** ([#6030](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6030)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n> test 1 = 2 and echo true or false\r\ntest: Expected a combining operator like '-a' at index 4\r\n1 = 2 and echo true or echo false\r\n      ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis includes numbering the index from 1 instead of 0, like fish lists.\r\n* **A new theme for the documentation and Web-based configuration** ([#6500](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6500), [#7371](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7371), [#7523](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7523)), matching the design on fishshell.com.\r\n* `fish --no-execute` **will no longer complain about unknown commands** or non-matching wildcards, as these could be defined differently at runtime (especially for functions). This makes it usable as a static syntax checker ([#977](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/977)).\r\n* `string match --regex` now integrates **named PCRE2 capture groups as fish variables**, allowing variables to be set directly from `string match` ([#7459](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7459)). To support this functionality, `string` is now a reserved word and can no longer be wrapped in a function.\r\n* Globs and other **expansions are limited to 512,288 results** ([#7226](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7226)). Because operating systems limit the number of arguments to commands, larger values are unlikely to work anyway, and this helps to avoid hangs.\r\n* A new **\"fish for bash users\" documentation page** gives a quick overview of the scripting differences between bash and fish ([#2382](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2382)), and the completion tutorial has also been moved out into its own document ([#6709](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6709)).\r\n\r\n### Syntax changes and new commands\r\n* Range limits in index range expansions like `$x[$start..$end]` may be omitted: `$start` and `$end` default to 1 and -1 (the last item) respectively ([#6574](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6574)):\r\n\r\n```\r\necho $var[1..]\r\necho $var[..-1]\r\necho $var[..]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll print the full list `$var`.\r\n* When globbing, a segment which is exactly `**` may now match zero directories. For example `**/foo` may match `foo` in the current directory ([#7222](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7222)).\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n* The `type`, `_` (gettext), `.` (source) and `:` (no-op) functions\r\nare now implemented builtins for performance purposes ([#7342](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7342), [#7036](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7036), [#6854](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6854)).\r\n* `set` and backgrounded jobs no longer overwrite `$pipestatus` ([#6820](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6820)), improving its use in command substitutions ([#6998](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6998)).\r\n* Computed (\"electric\") variables such as `status` are now only global in scope, so `set -Uq status` returns false ([#7032](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7032)).\r\n* The output for `set --show` has been shortened, only mentioning the scopes in which a variable exists ([#6944](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6944)). In addition, it now shows if a variable is a path variable.\r\n* A new variable, `fish_kill_signal`, is set to the signal that terminated the last foreground job, or `0` if the job exited normally ([#6824](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6824), [#6822](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6822)).\r\n* A new subcommand, `string pad`, allows extending strings to a given width ([#7340](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7340), [#7102](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7102)).\r\n* `string sub` has a new `--end` option to specify the end index of\r\na substring ([#6765](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6765), [#5974](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5974)).\r\n* `string split` has a new `--fields` option to specify fields to\r\noutput, similar to `cut -f` ([#6770](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6770)).\r\n* `string trim` now also trims vertical tabs by default ([#6795](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6795)).\r\n* `string replace` no longer prints an error if a capturing group wasn't matched, instead treating it as empty ([#7343](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7343)).\r\n* `string` subcommands now quit early when used with `--quiet` ([#7495](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7495)).\r\n* `string repeat` now handles multiple arguments, repeating each one ([#5988](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5988)).\r\n* `printf` no longer prints an error if not given an argument (not\r\neven a format string).\r\n* The `true` and `false` builtins ignore any arguments, like other shells ([#7030](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7030)).\r\n* `fish_indent` now removes unnecessary quotes in simple cases ([#6722](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6722))\r\nand gained a `--check` option to just check if a file is indented correctly ([#7251](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7251)).\r\n* `fish_indent` indents continuation lines that follow a line ending in a backslash, `|`, `&&` or `||`.\r\n* `pushd` only adds a directory to the stack if changing to it was successful ([#6947](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6947)).\r\n* A new `fish_job_summary` function is called whenever a background job stops or ends, or any job terminates from a signal ([#6959](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6959), [#2727](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2727), [#4319](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4319)).\r\nThe default behaviour can now be customized by redefining it.\r\n* `status` gained new `dirname` and `basename` convenience subcommands to get just the directory to the running script or the name of it, to simplify common tasks such as running `(dirname (status filename))` ([#7076](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7076), [#1818](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1818)).\r\n* Broken pipelines are now handled more smoothly; in particular, bad redirection mid-pipeline results in the job continuing to run but with the broken file descriptor replaced with a closed file descriptor. This allows better error recovery and is more in line with other shells' behaviour ([#7038](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7038)).\r\n* `jobs --quiet PID` no longer prints \"no suitable job\" if the job for PID does not exist (eg\u00a0because it has finished) ([#6809](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6809), [#6812](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6812)).\r\n* `jobs` now shows continued child processes correctly ([#6818](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6818))\r\n* `disown` should no longer create zombie processes when job control is off, such as in `config.fish` ([#7183](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7183)).\r\n* `command`, `jobs` and `type` builtins support `--query` as the long form of `-q`, matching other builtins.\r\nThe long form `--quiet` is deprecated ([#7276](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7276)).\r\n* `argparse` no longer requires a short flag letter for long-only options ([#7585](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7585))\r\nand only prints a backtrace with invalid options to argparse itself ([#6703](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6703)).\r\n* `argparse` now passes the validation variables (e.g. `$_flag_value`) as local-exported variables,\r\navoiding the need for `--no-scope-shadowing` in validation functions.\r\n* `complete` takes the first argument as the name of the command if the `--command`/`-c` option is not used,\r\nso `complete git` is treated like `complete --command git`,\r\nand it can show the loaded completions for specific commands with `complete COMMANDNAME` ([#7321](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7321)).\r\n* `set_color -b` (without an argument) no longer prints an error message, matching other invalid invocations of this command ([#7154](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7154)).\r\n* `exec` no longer produces a syntax error when the command cannot be found ([#6098](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6098)).\r\n* `set --erase` and `abbr --erase` can now erase multiple things in one go, matching `functions --erase` ([#7377](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7377)).\r\n* `abbr --erase` no longer prints errors when used with no arguments or on an unset abbreviation ([#7376](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7376), [#7732](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7732)).\r\n* `test -t`, for testing whether file descriptors are connected to a terminal, works for file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 ([#4766](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4766)).\r\nIt can still return incorrect results in other cases ([#1228](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1228)).\r\n* Trying to execute scripts with Windows line endings (CRLF) produces a sensible error ([#2783](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2783)).\r\n* Trying to execute commands with arguments that exceed the operating system limit now produces a specific error ([#6800](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6800)).\r\n* An `alias` that delegates to a command with the same name no longer triggers an error about recursive completion ([#7389](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7389)).\r\n* `math` now has a `--base` option to output the result in hexadecimal or octal ([#7496](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7496)) and produces more specific error messages ([#7508](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7508)).\r\n* `math` learned bitwise functions `bitand`, `bitor` and `bitxor`, used like `math \"bitand(0xFE, 5)\"` ([#7281](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7281)).\r\n* `math` learned tau for those who don't like typing \"2 \\* pi\".\r\n* Failed redirections will now set `$status` ([#7540](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7540)).\r\n* fish sets exit status in a more consistent manner after errors, including invalid expansions like `$foo[`.\r\n* Using `read --silent` while fish is in private mode was adding these potentially-sensitive entries to the history; this has been fixed ([#7230](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7230)).\r\n* `read` can now read interactively from other files, and can be used to read from the terminal via `read </dev/tty` (if the operating system provides `/dev/tty`) ([#7358](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7358)).\r\n* A new `fish_status_to_signal` function for transforming exit statuses to signal names has been added ([#7597](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7597), [#7595](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7595)).\r\n* The fallback `realpath` builtin supports the `-s`/`--no-symlinks` option, like GNU realpath ([#7574](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7574)).\r\n* `functions` and `type` now explain when a function was defined via `source` instead of just saying `Defined in -`.\r\n* Significant performance improvements when globbing, appending to variables or in `math`.\r\n* `echo` no longer interprets options at the beginning of an argument (eg `echo \"-n foo\"`) ([#7614](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7614)).\r\n* fish now finds user configuration even if the `HOME` environment variable is not set ([#7620](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7620)).\r\n* fish no longer crashes when started from a Windows-style working directory (eg `F:\\\\path`) ([#7636](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7636)).\r\n* `fish -c` now reads the remaining arguments into `$argv` ([#2314](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2314)).\r\n* The `pwd` command supports the long options `--logical` and `--physical`, matching other implementations ([#6787](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6787)).\r\n* `fish --profile` now only starts profiling after fish is ready to execute commands (all configuration is completed). There is a new `--profile-startup` option that only profiles the startup and configuration process ([#7648](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7648)).\r\n* Builtins return a maximum exit status of 255, rather than potentially overflowing. In particular, this affects `exit`, `return`, `functions --query`, and `set --query` ([#7698](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7698), [#7702](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7702)).\r\n* It is no longer an error to run builtin with closed stdin. For example `count <&-` now prints 0, instead of failing.\r\n* Blocks, functions, and builtins no longer permit redirecting to file descriptors other than 0 (standard input), 1 (standard output) and 2 (standard error). For example, `echo hello >&5` is now an error. This prevents corruption of internal state (#3303).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n* fish will now always attempt to become process group leader in interactive mode ([#7060](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7060)). This helps avoid hangs in certain circumstances, and allows tmux's current directory introspection to work ([#5699](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5699)).\r\n* The interactive reader now allows ending a line in a logical operators (`&&` and `||`) instead of complaining about a missing command. (This was already syntactically valid, but interactive sessions didn't know about it yet).\r\n* The prompt is reprinted after a background job exits ([#1018](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1018)).\r\n* fish no longer inserts a space after a completion ending in `.`, `,` or `-` is accepted, improving completions for tools that provide dynamic completions ([#6928](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6928)).\r\n* If a filename is invalid when first pressing `Tab`, but becomes valid, it will be completed properly on the next attempt ([#6863](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6863)).\r\n* `help string match/replace/<subcommand>` will show the help for string subcommands ([#6786](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6786)).\r\n* `fish_key_reader` sets the exit status to 0 when used with `--help` or `--version` ([#6964](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6964)).\r\n* `fish_key_reader` and `fish_indent` send output from `--version` to standard output, matching other fish binaries ([#6964](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6964)).\r\n* A new variable `$status_generation` is incremented only when the previous command produces an exit status ([#6815](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6815)). This can be used, for example, to check whether a failure status is a holdover due to a background job, or actually produced by the last run command.\r\n* `fish_greeting` is now a function that reads a variable of the same name, and defaults to setting it globally. This removes a universal variable by default and helps with updating the greeting. However, to disable the greeting it is now necessary to explicitly specify universal scope (`set -U fish_greeting`) or to disable it in config.fish ([#7265](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7265)).\r\n* Events are properly emitted after a job is cancelled ([#2356](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2356)).\r\n* `fish_preexec` and `fish_postexec` events are no longer triggered for empty commands ([#4829](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4829), [#7085](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7085)).\r\n* Functions triggered by the `fish_exit` event are correctly run when the terminal is closed or the shell receives SIGHUP ([#7014](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7014)).\r\n* The `fish_prompt` event no longer fires when `read` is used. If you need a function to run any time `read` is invoked by a script, use the new `fish_read` event instead ([#7039](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7039)).\r\n* A new `fish_posterror` event is emitted when attempting to execute a command with syntax errors ([#6880](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6880), [#6816](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6816)).\r\n* The debugging system has now fully switched from the old numbered level to the new named category system introduced in 3.1. A number of new debugging categories have been added, including `config`, `path`, `reader` and `screen` ([#6511](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6511)). See the output of `fish --print-debug-categories` for the full list.\r\n* The warning about read-only filesystems has been moved to a new \"warning-path\" debug category and can be disabled by setting a debug category of `-warning-path` ([#6630](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6630)):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfish --debug=-warning-path\r\n```\r\n* The enabled debug categories are now printed on shell startup ([#7007](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7007)).\r\n* The `-o` short option to fish, for `--debug-output`, works correctly instead of producing an invalid option error ([#7254](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7254)).\r\n* fish's debugging can now also be enabled via `FISH_DEBUG` and `FISH_DEBUG_OUTPUT` environment variables. This helps with debugging when no commandline options can be passed, like when fish is called in a shebang ([#7359](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7359)).\r\n* Abbreviations are now expanded after all command terminators (eg `;` or `|`), not just space, as in fish 2.7.1 and before ([#6970](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6970)), and after closing a command substitution ([#6658](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6658)).\r\n* The history file is now created with user-private permissions, matching other shells ([#6926](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6926)). The directory containing the history file was already private, so there should not have been any private data revealed.\r\n* The output of `time` is now properly aligned in all cases ([#6726](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6726), [#6714](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6714)) and no longer depends on locale ([#6757](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6757)).\r\n* The command-not-found handling has been simplified. When it can't find a command, fish now just executes a function called `fish_command_not_found` instead of firing an event, making it easier to replace and reason about. Previously-defined `__fish_command_not_found_handler` functions with an appropriate event listener will still work ([#7293](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7293)).\r\n* `Control-C` handling has been reimplemented in C++ and is therefore quicker ([#5259](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5259)), no longer occasionally prints an \"unknown command\" error ([#7145](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7145)) or overwrites multiline prompts ([#3537](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3537)).\r\n* `Control-C` no longer kills background jobs for which job control is\r\ndisabled, matching POSIX semantics ([#6828](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6828), [#6861](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6861)).\r\n* Autosuggestions work properly after `Control-C` cancels the current commmand line ([#6937](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6937)).\r\n* History search is now case-insensitive unless the search string contains an uppercase character ([#7273](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7273)).\r\n* `fish_update_completions` gained a new `--keep` option, which improves speed by skipping completions that already exist ([#6775](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6775), [#6796](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6796)).\r\n* Aliases containing an embedded backslash appear properly in the output of `alias` ([#6910](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6910)).\r\n* `open` no longer hangs indefinitely on certain systems, as a bug in `xdg-open` has been worked around ([#7215](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7215)).\r\n* Long command lines no longer add a blank line after execution ([#6826](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6826)) and behave better with `Backspace` ([#6951](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6951)).\r\n* `functions -t` works like the long option `--handlers-type`, as documented, instead of producing an error ([#6985](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6985)).\r\n* History search now flashes when it found no more results ([#7362](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7362))\r\n* fish now creates the path in the environment variable `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` if it does not exist, before using it for runtime data storage ([#7335](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7335)).\r\n* `set_color --print-colors` now also respects the bold, dim, underline, reverse, italic and background modifiers, to better show their effect ([#7314](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7314)).\r\n* The fish Web configuration tool (`fish_config`) shows prompts correctly on Termux for Android ([#7298](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7298)) and detects Windows Services for Linux 2 properly ([#7027](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7027)). It no longer shows the `history` variable as it may be too large (one can use the History tab instead). It also starts the browser in another thread, avoiding hangs in some circumstances, especially with Firefox's Developer Edition ([#7158](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7158)). Finally, a bug in the Source Code Pro font may cause browsers to hang, so this font is no longer chosen by default ([#7714](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7714)).\r\n* `funcsave` gained a new `--directory` option to specify the location of the saved function ([#7041](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7041)).\r\n* `help` works properly on MSYS2 ([#7113](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7113)) and only uses `cmd.exe` if running on WSL ([#6797](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6797)).\r\n* Resuming a piped job by its number, like `fg %1`, works correctly ([#7406](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7406)). Resumed jobs show the correct title in the terminal emulator ([#7444](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7444)).\r\n* Commands run from key bindings now use the same TTY modes as normal commands ([#7483](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7483)).\r\n* Autosuggestions from history are now case-sensitive ([#3978](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3978)).\r\n* `$status` from completion scripts is no longer passed outside the completion, which keeps the status display in the prompt as the last command's status ([#7555](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7555)).\r\n* Updated localisations for pt_BR ([#7480](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7480)).\r\n* `fish_trace` output now starts with `->` (like `fish --profile`), making the depth more visible ([#7538](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7538)).\r\n* Resizing the terminal window no longer produces a corrupted prompt ([#6532](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6532), [#7404](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7404)).\r\n* `functions` produces an error rather than crashing on certain invalid arguments ([#7515](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7515)).\r\n* A crash in completions with inline variable assignment (eg `A= b`) has been fixed ([#7344](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7344)).\r\n* `fish_private_mode` may now be changed dynamically using `set` ([#7589](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7589)), and history is kept in memory in private mode (but not stored permanently) ([#7590](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7590)).\r\n* Commands with leading spaces may be retrieved from history with up-arrow until a new command is run, matching zsh's `HIST_IGNORE_SPACE` ([#1383](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1383)).\r\n* Importing bash history or reporting errors with recursive globs (`\\*\\*`) no longer hangs ([#7407](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7407), [#7497](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7497)).\r\n* `bind` now shows `\\\\x7f` for the del key instead of a literal DEL character ([#7631](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7631))\r\n* Paths containing variables or tilde expansion are only suggested when they are still valid ([#7582](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7582)).\r\n* Syntax highlighting can now color a command as invalid even if executed quickly ([#5912](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5912)).\r\n* Redirection targets are no longer highlighted as error if they contain variables which will likely be defined by the current commandline ([#6654](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6654)).\r\n* fish is now more resilient against broken terminal modes ([#7133](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7133), [#4873](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4873)).\r\n* fish handles being in control of the TTY without owning its own process group better, avoiding some hangs in special configurations ([#7388](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7388)).\r\n* Keywords can now be colored differently by setting the `fish_color_keyword` variable (`fish_color_command` is used as a fallback) ([#7678](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7678)).\r\n* Just like `fish_indent`, the interactive reader will indent continuation lines that follow a line ending in a backslash, `|`, `&&` or `||` ([#7694](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7694)).\r\n* Commands with a trailing escaped space are saved in history correctly ([#7661](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7661)).\r\n* `fish_prompt` no longer mangles Unicode characters in the private-use range U+F600-U+F700. ([#7723](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7723)).\r\n* The universal variable file, `fish_variables`, can be made a symbolic link without it being overwritten ([#7466](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7466)).\r\n* fish is now more resilient against `mktemp` failing ([#7482](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7482)).\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n* As mentioned above, new special input functions `undo` (`Control+_` or `Control+Z`) and `redo` (`Alt-/`) can be used to revert changes to the command line or the pager search field ([#6570](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6570)).\r\n* `Control-Z` is now available for binding ([#7152](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7152)).\r\n* Additionally, using the `cancel` special input function (bound to `Escape` by default) right after fish picked an unambiguous completion will undo that ([#7433](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7433)).\r\n* `fish_clipboard_paste` (`Control+V`) trims indentation from multiline commands, because fish already indents ([#7662](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7662)).\r\n* Vi mode bindings now support `dh`, `dl`, `c0`, `cf`, `ct`, `cF`, `cT`, `ch`, `cl`, `y0`, `ci`, `ca`, `yi`, `ya`, `di`, `da`, `d;`, `d,`, `o`, `O` and Control+left/right keys to navigate by word ([#6648](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6648), [#6755](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6755), [#6769](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6769), [#7442](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7442), [#7516](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7516)).\r\n* Vi mode bindings support `~` (tilde) to toggle the case of the selected character ([#6908](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6908)).\r\n* Functions `up-or-search` and `down-or-search` (`Up` and `Down`) can cross empty lines, and don't activate search mode if the search fails, which makes them easier to use to move between lines in some situations.\r\n* If history search fails to find a match, the cursor is no longer moved. This is useful when accidentally starting a history search on a multi-line commandline.\r\n* The special input function `beginning-of-history` (`Page Up`) now moves to the oldest search instead of the youngest - that's `end-of-history` (`Page Down`).\r\n* A new special input function `forward-single-char` moves one character to the right, and if an autosuggestion is available, only take a single character from it ([#7217](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7217), [#4984](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4984)).\r\n* Special input functions can now be joined with `or` as a modifier (adding to `and`), though only some commands set an exit status ([#7217](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7217)). This includes `suppress-autosuggestion` to reflect whether an autosuggestion was suppressed ([#1419](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1419))\r\n* A new function `__fish_preview_current_file`, bound to `Alt+O`, opens the\r\ncurrent file at the cursor in a pager ([#6838](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6838), [#6855](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6855)).\r\n* `edit_command_buffer` (`Alt-E` and `Alt-V`) passes the cursor position\r\nto the external editor if the editor is recognized ([#6138](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6138), [#6954](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6954)).\r\n* `__fish_prepend_sudo` (`Alt-S`) now toggles a `sudo` prefix ([#7012](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7012)) and avoids shifting the cursor ([#6542](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6542)).\r\n* `__fish_prepend_sudo` (`Alt-S`) now uses the previous commandline if the current one is empty, to simplify rerunning the previous command with `sudo` ([#7079](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7079)).\r\n* `__fish_toggle_comment_commandline` (`Alt-#`) now uncomments and presents the last comment from history if the commandline is empty ([#7137](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7137)).\r\n* `__fish_whatis_current_token` (`Alt-W`) prints descriptions for functions and builtins ([#7191](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7191), [#2083](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2083)).\r\n* The definition of \"word\" and \"bigword\" for movements was refined, fixing (eg) vi mode's behavior with `e` on the second-to-last char, and bigword's behavior with single-character words and non-blank non-graphical characters ([#7353](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7353), [#7354](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7354), [#4025](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4025), [#7328](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7328), [#7325](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7325))\r\n* fish's clipboard bindings now also support Windows Subsystem for Linux via PowerShell and clip.exe ([#7455](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7455), [#7458](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7458)) and will properly copy newlines in multi-line commands.\r\n* Using the `\\*-jump` special input functions before typing anything else no longer crashes fish.\r\n* Completing variable overrides (`foo=bar`) could replace the entire thing with just the completion in some circumstances. This has been fixed ([#7398](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7398)).\r\n\r\n#### Improved prompts\r\n* The default and example prompts print the correct exit status for commands prefixed with `not` ([#6566](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6566)).\r\n* git prompts include all untracked files in the repository, not just those in the current directory ([#6086](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6086)).\r\n* The git prompts correctly show stash states ([#6876](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6876), [#7136](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7136)) and clean states ([#7471](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7471)).\r\n* The Mercurial prompt correctly shows untracked status ([#6906](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6906)), and by default only shows the branch for performance reasons.\r\nA new variable `$fish_prompt_hg_show_informative_status` can be set to enable more information.\r\n* The `fish_vcs_prompt` passes its arguments to the various VCS prompts that it calls ([#7033](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7033)).\r\n* The Subversion prompt was broken in a number of ways in 3.1.0 and has been restored ([#6715](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6715), [#7278](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7278)).\r\n* A new helper function `fish_is_root_user` simplifies checking for superuser privilege ([#7031](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7031), [#7123](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7123)).\r\n* New colorschemes - `ayu Light`, `ayu Dark` and `ayu Mirage` ([#7596](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7596)).\r\n* Bugs related to multiline prompts, including repainting ([#5860](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5860)) or navigating directory history ([#3550](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3550)) leading to graphical glitches have been fixed.\r\n* The `nim` prompt now handles vi mode better ([#6802](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6802))\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal support\r\n* A new variable, `fish_vi_force_cursor`, can be set to force `fish_vi_cursor` to attempt changing the cursor\r\nshape in vi mode, regardless of terminal ([#6968](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6968)). The `fish_vi_cursor` option `--force-iterm` has been deprecated.\r\n* `diff` will now colourize output, if supported ([#7308](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7308)).\r\n* Autosuggestions appear when the cursor passes the right prompt ([#6948](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6948)) or wraps to the next line ([#7213](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7213)).\r\n* The cursor shape in Vi mode changes properly in Windows Terminal ([#6999](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6999), [#6478](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6478)).\r\n* The spurious warning about terminal size in small terminals has been removed ([#6980](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6980)).\r\n* Dynamic titles are now enabled in Alacritty ([#7073](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7073)) and emacs' vterm ([#7122](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7122)).\r\n* Current working directory updates are enabled in foot ([#7099](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7099)) and WezTerm ([#7649](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7649)).\r\n* The width computation for certain emoji agrees better with terminals (especially flags). ([#7237](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7237)).\r\n* Long command lines are wrapped in all cases, instead of sometimes being put on a new line ([#5118](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5118)).\r\n* The pager is properly rendered with long command lines selected ([#2557](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2557)).\r\n* Sessions with right prompts can be resized correctly in terminals that handle reflow, like GNOME Terminal (and other VTE-based terminals), upcoming Konsole releases and Alacritty. This detection can be overridden with the new `fish_handle_reflow` variable ([#7491](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7491)).\r\n* fish now sets terminal modes sooner, which stops output from appearing before the greeting and prompt are ready ([#7489](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7489)).\r\n* Better detection of new Konsole versions for true color support and cursor shape changing.\r\n* fish no longer attempts to modify the terminal size via `TIOCSWINSZ`, improving compatibility with Kitty ([#6994](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6994)).\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n* Added completions for\r\n    * `7z`, `7za` and `7zr`

like `from..to` or `left...right`.\r\n    * Completion scripts for custom Git subcommands like `git-xyz` are now loaded with Git completions. The completions can now be defined directly on the subcommand (using `complete git-xyz`), and completion for `git xyz` will work. ([#7075](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7075), [#7652](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7652), [#4358](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4358))\r\n    * `make` completions no longer second-guess make's file detection, fixing target completion in some cases ([#7535](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7535)).\r\n    * Command completions now correctly print the description even if the command was fully matched (like in `ls<TAB>`).\r\n    * `set` completions no longer hide variables starting with `__`, they are sorted last instead.\r\n* Improvements to the manual page completion generator ([#7086](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7086), [#6879](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6879), [#7187](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7187)).\r\n* Significant performance improvements to completion of the available commands ([#7153](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7153)), especially on macOS Big Sur where there was a significant regression ([#7365](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7365), [#7511](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7511)).\r\n* Suffix completion using `__fish_complete_suffix` uses the same fuzzy matching logic as normal file completion, and completes any file but sorts files with matching suffix first ([#7040](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7040), [#7547](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7547)). Previously, it only completed files with matching suffix.\r\n\r\n### For distributors\r\n* fish has a new interactive test driver based on pexpect, removing the optional dependency on expect (and adding an optional dependency on pexpect) ([#5451](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5451), [#6825](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6825)).\r\n* The CHANGELOG was moved to restructured text, allowing it to be included in the documentation ([#7057](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7057)).\r\n* fish handles ncurses installed in a non-standard prefix better ([#6600](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6600), [#7219](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7219)), and uses variadic tparm on NetBSD curses ([#6626](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6626)).\r\n* The Web-based configuration tool no longer uses an obsolete Angular version ([#7147](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7147)).\r\n* The fish project has adopted the Contributor Covenant code of conduct ([#7151](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7151)).\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n* The `fish_color_match` variable is no longer used. (Previously this controlled the color of matching quotes and parens when using `read`).\r\n* fish 3.2.0 will be the last release in which the redirection to standard error with the `^` character is enabled. The `stderr-nocaret` feature flag will be changed to \"on\" in future releases.\r\n* `string` is now a reserved word and cannot be used for function names (see above).\r\n* `fish_vi_cursor`'s option `--force-iterm` has been deprecated (see above).\r\n* `command`, `jobs` and `type` long-form option `--quiet` is deprecated in favor of `--query` (see above).\r\n* The `fish_command_not_found` event is no longer emitted, instead there is a function of that name. By default it will call a previously-defined `__fish_command_not_found_handler`. To emit the event manually use `emit fish_command_not_found`.\r\n* The `fish_prompt` event no longer fires when `read` is used. If you need a function to run any time `read` is invoked by a script, use the new `fish_read` event instead ([#7039](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7039)).\r\n* To disable the greeting message permanently it is no longer enough to just run `set fish_greeting` interactively as it is no longer implicitly a universal variable. Use `set -U fish_greeting` or disable it in config.fish with `set -g fish_greeting`.\r\n* The long-deprecated and non-functional `-m`/`--read-mode` options to `read` were removed in 3.1b1. Using the short form, or a never-implemented `-B` option, no longer crashes fish ([#7659](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7659)).\r\n* With the addition of new categories for debug options, the old numbered debugging levels have been removed.\r\n\r\n### For distributors and developers\r\n* fish source tarballs are now distributed using the XZ compression\r\nmethod ([#5460](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5460)).\r\n* The fish source tarball contains an example FreeDesktop entry and icon.\r\n* The CMake variable `MAC_CODESIGN_ID` can now be set to \"off\" to disable code-signing ([#6952](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6952), [#6792](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6792)).\r\n* Building on on macOS earlier than 10.13.6 succeeds, instead of failing on code-signing ([#6791](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6791)).\r\n* The pkg-config file now uses variables to ensure paths used are portable across prefixes.\r\n* The default values for the `extra_completionsdir`, `extra_functionsdir` and `extra_confdir` options now use the installation prefix rather than `/usr/local` ([#6778](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6778)).\r\n* A new CMake variable `FISH_USE_SYSTEM_PCRE2` controls whether fish builds with the system-installed PCRE2, or the version it bundles. By default it prefers the system library if available, unless Mac codesigning is enabled ([#6952](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6952)).\r\n* Running the full interactive test suite now requires Python 3.5+ and the pexpect package ([#6825](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6825)); the expect package is no longer required.\r\n* Support for Python 2 in fish's tools (`fish_config` and the manual page completion generator) is no longer guaranteed. Please use Python 3.5 or later ([#6537](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6537)).\r\n* The Web-based configuration tool is compatible with Python 3.10  ([#7600](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7600)) and no longer requires Python's distutils package ([#7514](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7514)).\r\n* fish 3.2 is the last release to support Red Hat Enterprise Linux & CentOS version 6.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDownload links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.2.0.tar.xz\".

A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"`fish-3.1.1.tar.gz.asc`\".*\r\n\r\nThis release of fish fixes a number of major issues discovered in fish 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n- Commands which involve `. ( ... | psub)` now work correctly, as a bug in the `function --on-job-exit` option has been fixed (#6613).\r\n- Conflicts between upstream packages for ripgrep and bat, and the fish packages, have been resolved (#5822).\r\n- Starting fish in a directory without read access, such as via `su`, no longer crashes (#6597).\r\n- Glob ordering changes which were introduced in 3.1.0 have been reverted, returning the order of globs to the previous state (#6593).\r\n- Redirections using the deprecated caret syntax to a file descriptor (eg `^&2`) work correctly (#6591).\r\n- Redirections that append to a file descriptor (eg `2>>&1`) work correctly (#6614).\r\n- Building fish on macOS (#6602) or with new versions of GCC (#6604, #6609) is now successful.\r\n- `time` is now correctly listed in the output of `builtin -n`, and `time --help` works correctly (#6598).\r\n- Exported universal variables now update properly (#6612).\r\n- `status current-command` gives the expected output when used with an environment override - that is, `F=B status current-command` returns `status` instead of `F=B` (#6635).\r\n- `test` no longer crashes when used with \"`nan`\" or \"`inf`\" arguments, erroring out instead (#6655).\r\n- Copying from the end of the command line no longer crashes fish (#6680).\r\n- `read` no longer removes multiple separators when splitting a variable into a list, restoring the previous behaviour from fish 3.0 and before (#6650).\r\n- Functions using `--on-job-exit` and `--on-process-exit` work reliably again (#6679).\r\n- Functions using `--on-signal INT` work reliably in interactive sessions, as they did in fish 2.7 and before (#6649). These handlers have never worked in non-interactive sessions, and making them work is an ongoing process.\r\n- Functions using `--on-variable` work reliably with variables which are set implicitly (rather than with `set`), such as \"`fish_bind_mode`\" and \"`PWD`\" (#6653).\r\n- 256 colors are properly enabled under certain conditions that were incorrectly detected in fish 3.1.0 (`$TERM` begins with xterm, does not include \"`256color`\", and `$TERM_PROGRAM` is not set) (#6701).\r\n- The Mercurial (`hg`) prompt no longer produces an error when the current working directory is removed (#6699). Also, for performance reasons it shows only basic information by default; to restore the detailed status, set `$fish_prompt_hg_show_informative_status`.\r\n- The VCS prompt, `fish_vcs_prompt`, no longer displays Subversion (`svn`) status by default, due to the potential slowness of this operation (#6681).\r\n- Pasting of commands has been sped up (#6713).\r\n- Using extended Unicode characters, such as emoji, in a non-Unicode capable locale (such as the `C` or `POSIX` locale) no longer renders all output blank (#6736).\r\n- `help` prefers to use `xdg-open`, avoiding the use of `open` on Debian systems where this command is actually `openvt` (#6739).\r\n- Command lines starting with a space, which are not saved in history, now do not get autosuggestions. This fixes an issue with Midnight Commander integration (#6763), but may be changed in a future version.\r\n- Copying to the clipboard no longer inserts a newline at the end of the content, matching fish 2.7 and earlier (#6927).\r\n- `fzf` in complex pipes no longer hangs. More generally, code run as part of command substitutions or `eval` will no longer have separate process groups. (#6624, #6806).\r\n\r\nThis release also includes:\r\n- a number of changes to improve macOS compatibility with code signing and notarization;\r\n- a number of improvements to completions; and\r\n- a number of content and formatting improvements to the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 3.0.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.1.0 and 3.1b1.\r\n\r\n## Errata for fish 3.1\r\n\r\nA new builtin, `time`, was introduced in the fish 3.1 releases. This builtin is a reserved word (like `test`, `function`, and others) because of the way it is implemented, and functions can no longer be named `time`. This was not clear in the fish 3.1b1 release notes.",

A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"`fish-3.1.0.tar.gz.asc`\".*\r\n\r\nCompared to the beta release of fish 3.1b1, fish version 3.1.0:\r\n- fixes a regression where spaces after a brace were removed despite brace expansion not occurring (#6564)\r\n- fixes a number of problems in compiling and testing on Cygwin (#6549) and Solaris-derived systems such as Illumos (#6553, #6554, #6555, #6556, and #6558); \r\n- fixes the process for building macOS packages; and\r\n- contains some improvements to the documentation and a small number of completions.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 3.0.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.1b1 (included below).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# fish 3.1b1 (released January 26, 2020)\r\n\r\n## Notable improvements and fixes\r\n- A new `$pipestatus` variable contains a list of exit statuses of the previous job, for each of the separate commands in a pipeline (#5632).\r\n- fish no longer buffers pipes to the last function in a pipeline, improving many cases where pipes appeared to block or hang (#1396).\r\n- An overhaul of error messages for builtin commands, including a removal of the overwhelming usage summary, more readable stack traces (#3404, #5434), and stack traces for `test` (aka `[`) (#5771).\r\n- fish's debugging arguments have been significantly improved. The `--debug-level` option has been removed, and a new `--debug` option replaces it. This option accepts various categories, which may be listed via `fish --print-debug-categories` (#5879). A new `--debug-output` option allows for redirection of debug output.\r\n- `string` has a new `collect` subcommand for use in command substitutions, producing a single output instead of splitting on new lines (similar to `\"$(cmd)\"` in other shells) (#159).\r\n- The fish manual, tutorial and FAQ are now available in `man` format as `fish-doc`, `fish-tutorial` and `fish-faq` respectively (#5521).\r\n- Like other shells, `cd` now always looks for its argument in the current directory as a last resort, even if the `CDPATH` variable does not include it or \".\" (#4484).\r\n- fish now correctly handles `CDPATH` entries that start with `..` (#6220) or contain `./` (#5887).\r\n- The `fish_trace` variable may be set to trace execution (#3427). This performs a similar role as `set -x` in other shells.\r\n- fish uses the temporary directory determined by the system, rather than relying on `/tmp` (#3845).\r\n- The fish Web configuration tool (`fish_config`) prints a list of commands it is executing, to help understanding and debugging (#5584).\r\n- Major performance improvements when pasting (#5866), executing lots of commands (#5905), importing history from bash (#6295), and when completing variables that might match `$history` (#6288).\r\n\r\n### Syntax changes and new commands\r\n- A new builtin command, `time`, which allows timing of fish functions and builtins as well as external commands (#117).\r\n- Brace expansion now only takes place if the braces include a \",\" or a variable expansion, meaning common commands such as `git reset HEAD@{0}` do not require escaping (#5869).\r\n- New redirections `&>` and `&|` may be used to redirect or pipe stdout, and also redirect stderr to stdout (#6192).\r\n- `switch` now allows arguments that expand to nothing, like empty variables (#5677).\r\n- The `VAR=val cmd` syntax can now be used to run a command in a modified environment (#6287).\r\n- `and` is no longer recognised as a command, so that nonsensical constructs like `and and and` produce a syntax error (#6089).\r\n- `math`'s exponent operator, '`^`', was previously left-associative, but now uses the more commonly-used right-associative behaviour (#6280). This means that `math '3^0.5^2'` was previously calculated as '(3^0.5)^2', but is now calculated as '3^(0.5^2)'.\r\n- In fish 3.0, the variable used with `for` loops inside command substitutions could leak into enclosing scopes; this was an inadvertent behaviour change and has been reverted (#6480).\r\n\r\n### Scripting improvements\r\n- `string split0` now returns 0 if it split something (#5701).\r\n- In the interest of consistency, `builtin -q` and `command -q` can now be used to query if a builtin or command exists (#5631).\r\n- `math` now accepts `--scale=max` for the maximum scale (#5579).\r\n- `builtin $var` now works correctly, allowing a variable as the builtin name (#5639).\r\n- `cd` understands the `--` argument to make it possible to change to directories starting with a hyphen (#6071).\r\n- `complete --do-complete` now also does fuzzy matches (#5467).\r\n- `complete --do-complete` can be used inside completions, allowing limited recursion (#3474).\r\n- `count` now also counts lines fed on standard input (#5744).\r\n- `eval` produces an exit status of 0 when given no arguments, like other shells (#5692).\r\n- `printf` prints what it can when input hasn't been fully converted to a number, but still prints an error (#5532).\r\n- `complete -C foo` now works as expected, rather than requiring `complete -Cfoo`.\r\n- `complete` has a new `--force-files` option, to re-enable file completions. This allows `sudo -E` and `pacman -Qo` to complete correctly (#5646).\r\n- `argparse` now defaults to showing the current function name (instead of `argparse`) in its errors, making `--name` often superfluous (#5835).\r\n- `argparse` has a new `--ignore-unknown` option to keep unrecognized options, allowing multiple argparse passes to parse options (#5367).\r\n- `argparse` correctly handles flag value validation of options that only have short names (#5864).\r\n- `read -S` (short option of `--shell`) is recognised correctly (#5660).\r\n- `read` understands `--list`, which acts like `--array` in reading all arguments into a list inside a single variable, but is better named (#5846).\r\n- `read` has a new option, `--tokenize`, which splits a string into variables according to the shell's tokenization rules, considering quoting, escaping, and so on (#3823).\r\n- `read` interacts more correctly with the deprecated `$IFS` variable, in particular removing multiple separators when splitting a variable into a list (#6406), matching other shells.\r\n- `fish_indent` now handles semicolons better, including leaving them in place for `; and` and `; or` instead of breaking the line (#5859).\r\n- `fish_indent --write` now supports multiple file arguments, indenting them in turn.\r\n- The default read limit has been increased to 100MiB (#5267).\r\n- `math` now also understands `x` for multiplication, provided it is followed by whitespace (#5906).\r\n- `math` reports the right error when incorrect syntax is used inside parentheses (#6063), and warns when unsupported logical operations are used (#6096).\r\n- `functions --erase` now also prevents fish from autoloading a function for the first time (#5951).\r\n- `jobs --last` returns 0 to indicate success when a job is found (#6104).\r\n- `commandline -p` and `commandline -j` now split on `&&` and `||` in addition to `;` and `&` (#6214).\r\n- A bug where `string split` would drop empty strings if the output was only empty strings has been fixed (#5987).\r\n- `eval` no long creates a new local variable scope, but affects variables in the scope it is called from (#4443). `source` still creates a new local scope.\r\n- `abbr` has a new `--query` option to check for the existence of an abbreviation.\r\n- Local values for `fish_complete_path` and `fish_function_path` are now ignored; only their global values are respected.\r\n- Syntax error reports now display a marker in the correct position (#5812).\r\n- Empty universal variables may now be exported (#5992).\r\n- Exported universal variables are no longer imported into the global scope, preventing shadowing. This makes it easier to change such variables for all fish sessions and avoids breakage when the value is a list of multiple elements (#5258).\r\n- A bug where `for` could use invalid variable names has been fixed (#5800).\r\n- A bug where local variables would not be exported to functions has been fixed (#6153).\r\n- The null command (`:`) now always exits successfully, rather than passing through the previous exit status (#6022).\r\n- The output of `functions FUNCTION` matches the declaration of the function, correctly including comments or blank lines (#5285), and correctly includes any `--wraps` flags (#1625).\r\n- `type` supports a new option, `--short`, which suppress function expansion (#6403).\r\n- `type --path` with a function argument will now output the path to the file containing the definition of that function, if it exists.\r\n- `type --force-path` with an argument that cannot be found now correctly outputs nothing, as documented (#6411).\r\n- The `$hostname` variable is no longer truncated to 32 characters (#5758).\r\n- Line numbers in function backtraces are calculated correctly (#6350).\r\n- A new `fish_cancel` event is emitted when the command line is cancelled, which is useful for terminal integration (#5973).\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n- New Base16 color options are available through the Web-based configuration (#6504).\r\n- fish only parses `/etc/paths` on macOS in login shells, matching the bash implementation (#5637) and avoiding changes to path ordering in child shells (#5456). It now ignores blank lines like the bash implementation (#5809).\r\n- The locale is now reloaded when the `LOCPATH` variable is changed (#5815).\r\n- `read` no longer keeps a history, making it suitable for operations that shouldn't end up there, like password entry (#5904).\r\n- `dirh` outputs its stack in the correct order (#5477), and behaves as documented when universal variables are used for its stack (#5797).\r\n- `funced` and the edit-commandline-in-buffer bindings did not work in fish 3.0 when the `$EDITOR` variable contained spaces; this has been corrected (#5625).\r\n- Builtins now pipe their help output to a pager automatically (#6227).\r\n- `set_color` now colors the `--print-colors` output in the matching colors if it is going to a terminal.\r\n- fish now underlines every valid entered path instead of just the last one (#5872).\r\n- When syntax highlighting a string with an unclosed quote, only the quote itself will be shown as an error, instead of the whole argument.\r\n- Syntax highlighting works correctly with variables as commands (#5658) and redirections to close file descriptors (#6092).\r\n- `help` works properly on Windows Subsytem for Linux (#5759, #6338).\r\n- A bug where `disown` could crash the shell has been fixed (#5720).\r\n- fish will not autosuggest files ending with `~` unless there are no other candidates, as these are generally backup files (#985).\r\n- Escape in the pager works correctly (#5818).\r\n- Key bindings that call `fg` no longer leave the terminal in a broken state (#2114).\r\n- Brackets (#5831) and filenames containing `$` (#6060) are completed with appropriate escaping.\r\n- The output of `complete` and `functions` is now colorized in interactive terminals.\r\n- The Web-based configuration handles aliases that include single quotes correctly (#6120), and launches correctly under Termux (#6248) and OpenBSD (#6522).\r\n- `function` now correctly validates parameters for `--argument-names` as valid variable names (#6147) and correctly parses options following `--argument-names`, as in \"`--argument-names foo --description bar`\" (#6186).\r\n- History newly imported from bash includes command lines using `&&` or `||`.\r\n- The automatic generation of completions from manual pages is better described in job and process listings, and no longer produces a warning when exiting fish (#6269).\r\n- In private mode, setting `$fish_greeting` to an empty string before starting the private session will prevent the warning about history not being saved from being printed (#6299).\r\n- In the interactive editor, a line break (Enter) inside unclosed brackets will insert a new line, rather than executing the command and producing an error (#6316).\r\n- Ctrl-C always repaints the prompt (#6394).\r\n- When run interactively from another program (such as Python), fish will correctly start a new process group, like other shells (#5909).\r\n- Job identifiers (for example, for background jobs) are assigned more logically (#6053).\r\n- A bug where history would appear truncated if an empty command was executed was fixed (#6032).\r\n\r\n#### New or improved bindings\r\n- Pasting strips leading spaces to avoid pasted commands being omitted from the history (#4327).\r\n- Shift-Left and Shift-Right now default to moving backwards and forwards by one bigword (words separated by whitespace) (#1505).\r\n- The default escape delay (to differentiate between the escape key and an alt-combination) has been reduced to 30ms, down from 300ms for the default mode and 100ms for Vi mode (#3904).\r\n- The `forward-bigword` binding now interacts correctly with autosuggestions (#5336).\r\n- The `fish_clipboard_*` functions support Wayland by using [`wl-clipboard`](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) (#5450).\r\n- The `nextd` and `prevd` functions no longer print \"Hit end of history\", instead using a bell. They correctly store working directories containing symbolic links (#6395).\r\n- If a `fish_mode_prompt` function exists, Vi mode will only execute it on mode-switch instead of the entire prompt. This should make it much more responsive with slow prompts (#5783).\r\n- The path-component bindings (like Ctrl-w) now also stop at \":\" and \"@\", because those are used to denote user and host in commands such as `ssh` (#5841).\r\n- The NULL character can now be bound via `bind -k nul`. Terminals often generate this character via control-space. (#3189).\r\n- A new readline command `expand-abbr` can be used to trigger abbreviation expansion (#5762).\r\n- A new readline command, `delete-or-exit`, removes a character to the right of the cursor or exits the shell if the command line is empty (moving this functionality out of the `delete-or-exit` function).\r\n- The `self-insert` readline command will now insert the binding sequence, if not empty.\r\n- A new binding to prepend `sudo`, bound to Alt-S by default (#6140).\r\n- The Alt-W binding to describe a command should now work better with multiline prompts (#6110)\r\n- The Alt-H binding to open a command's man page now tries to ignore `sudo` (#6122).\r\n- A new pair of bind functions, `history-prefix-search-backward` (and `forward`), was introduced (#6143).\r\n- Vi mode now supports R to enter replace mode (#6342), and `d0` to delete the current line (#6292).\r\n- In Vi mode, hitting Enter in replace-one mode no longer erases the prompt (#6298).\r\n- Selections in Vi mode are inclusive, matching the actual behaviour of Vi (#5770).\r\n\r\n#### Improved prompts\r\n- The Git prompt in informative mode now shows the number of stashes if enabled.\r\n- The Git prompt now has an option (`$__fish_git_prompt_use_informative_chars`) to use the (more modern) informative characters without enabling informative mode.\r\n- The default prompt now also features VCS integration and will color the host if running via SSH (#6375).\r\n- The default and example prompts print the pipe status if an earlier command in the pipe fails.\r\n- The default and example prompts try to resolve exit statuses to signal names when appropriate.\r\n\r\n#### Improved terminal output\r\n- New `fish_pager_color_` options have been added to control more elements of the pager's colors (#5524).\r\n- Better detection and support for using fish from various system consoles, where limited colors and special characters are supported (#5552).\r\n- fish now tries to guess if the system supports Unicode 9 (and displays emoji as wide), eliminating the need to set `$fish_emoji_width` in most cases (#5722).\r\n- Improvements to the display of wide characters, particularly Korean characters and emoji (#5583, #5729).\r\n- The Vi mode cursor is correctly redrawn when regaining focus under terminals that report focus (eg tmux) (#4788).\r\n- Variables that control background colors (such as `fish_pager_color_search_match`) can now use `--reverse`.\r\n\r\n#### Completions\r\n- Added completions for\r\n  - `aws`\r\n  - `bat` (#6052)\r\n  - `bosh` (#5700)\r\n  - `btrfs`\r\n  - `camcontrol`\r\n  - `cf` (#5700)\r\n  - `chronyc` (#6496)\r\n  - `code` (#6205)\r\n  - `cryptsetup` (#6488)\r\n  - `csc` and `csi` (#6016)\r\n  - `cwebp` (#6034)\r\n  - `cygpath` and `cygstart` (#6239)\r\n  - `epkginfo` (#5829)\r\n  - `ffmpeg`, `ffplay`, and `ffprobe` (#5922)\r\n  - `fsharpc` and `fsharpi` (#6016)\r\n  - `fzf` (#6178)\r\n  - `g++` (#6217)\r\n  - `gpg1` (#6139)\r\n  - `gpg2` (#6062)\r\n  - `grub-mkrescue` (#6182)\r\n  - `hledger` (#6043)\r\n  - `hwinfo` (#6496)\r\n  - `irb` (#6260)\r\n  - `iw` (#6232)\r\n  - `kak`\r\n  - `keepassxc-cli` (#6505)\r\n  - `keybase` (#6410)\r\n  - `loginctl` (#6501)\r\n  - `lz4`, `lz4c` and `lz4cat` (#6364)\r\n  - `mariner` (#5718)\r\n  - `nethack` (#6240)\r\n  - `patool` (#6083)\r\n  - `phpunit` (#6197)\r\n  - `plutil` (#6301)\r\n  - `pzstd` (#6364)\r\n  - `qubes-gpg-client` (#6067)\r\n  - `resolvectl` (#6501)\r\n  - `rg`\r\n  - `rustup`\r\n  - `sfdx` (#6149)\r\n  - `speedtest` and `speedtest-cli` (#5840)\r\n  - `src` (#6026)\r\n  - `tokei` (#6085)\r\n  - `tsc` (#6016)\r\n  - `unlz4` (#6364)\r\n  - `unzstd` (#6364)\r\n  - `vbc` (#6016)\r\n  - `zpaq` (#6245)\r\n  - `zstd`, `zstdcat`, `zstdgrep`, `zstdless` and `zstdmt` (#6364)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions.\r\n- Selecting short options which also have a long name from the completion pager is possible (#5634).\r\n- Tab completion will no longer add trailing spaces if they already exist (#6107).\r\n- Completion of subcommands to builtins like `and` or `not` now works correctly (#6249).\r\n- Completion of arguments to short options works correctly when multiple short options are used together (#332).\r\n- Activating completion in the middle of an invalid completion does not move the cursor any more, making it easier to fix a mistake (#4124).\r\n- Completion in empty commandlines now lists all available commands.\r\n- Functions listed as completions could previously leak parts of the function as other completions; this has been fixed.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations and removed features\r\n- The vcs-prompt functions have been promoted to names without double-underscore, so __fish_git_prompt is now fish_git_prompt, __fish_vcs_prompt is now fish_vcs_prompt, __fish_hg_prompt is now fish_hg_prompt and __fish_svn_prompt is now fish_svn_prompt. Shims at the old names have been added, and the variables have kept their old names (#5586).\r\n- `string replace` has an additional round of escaping in the replacement expression, so escaping backslashes requires many escapes (eg `string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$1' a`). The new feature flag `regex-easyesc` can be used to disable this, so that the same effect can be achieved with `string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\\\\\$1' a` (#5556). As a reminder, the intention behind feature flags is that this will eventually become the default and then only option, so scripts should be updated.\r\n- The `fish_vi_mode` function, deprecated in fish 2.3, has been removed. Use `fish_vi_key_bindings` instead (#6372).\r\n\r\n### For distributors and developers\r\n- fish 3.0 introduced a CMake-based build system. In fish 3.1, both the Autotools-based build and legacy Xcode build system have been removed, leaving only the CMake build system. All distributors and developers must install CMake.\r\n- fish now depends on the common `tee` external command, for the `psub` process substitution function.\r\n- The documentation is now built with Sphinx. The old Doxygen-based documentation system has been removed. Developers, and distributors who wish to rebuild the documentation, must install Sphinx.\r\n- The `INTERNAL_WCWIDTH` build option has been removed, as fish now always uses an internal `wcwidth` function. It has a number of configuration options that make it more suitable for general use (#5777).\r\n- mandoc can now be used to format the output from `--help` if `nroff` is not installed, reducing the number of external dependencies on systems with `mandoc` installed (#5489).\r\n- Some bugs preventing building on Solaris-derived systems such as Illumos were fixed (#5458, #5461, #5611).\r\n- Completions for `npm`, `bower` and `yarn` no longer require the `jq` utility for full functionality, but will use Python instead if it is available.\r\n- The paths for completions, functions and configuration snippets have been extended. On systems that define `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, each of the directories in this variable are searched in the subdirectories `fish/vendor_completions.d`, `fish/vendor_functions.d`, and `fish/vendor_conf.d` respectively. On systems that do not define this variable in the environment, the vendor directories are searched for in both the installation prefix and the default \"extra\" directory, which now defaults to `/usr/local` (#5029).",

        "body": "This release of fish fixes a number of major issues discovered in fish 3.0.0.\r\n\r\n*Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.0.1.tar.gz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is 21677a5755ee1738bad2cf8179c104068f8bb81b969660d5a2af4ba6eceba5e4. A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"fish-3.0.1.tar.gz.asc\".*\r\n\r\n### Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n- `exec` does not complain about running foreground jobs when called (#5449).\r\n- while loops now evaluate to the last executed command in the loop body (or zero if the body was empty), matching POSIX semantics (#4982).\r\n- `read --silent` no longer echoes to the tty when run from a non-interactive script (#5519).\r\n- On macOS, path entries with spaces in `/etc/paths` and `/etc/paths.d` now correctly set path entries with spaces. Likewise, `MANPATH` is correctly set from `/etc/manpaths` and `/etc/manpaths.d` (#5481).\r\n- fish starts correctly under Cygwin/MSYS2 (#5426).\r\n- The `pager-toggle-search` binding (Ctrl-S by default) will now activate the search field, even when the pager is not focused.\r\n- The error when a command is not found is now printed a single time, instead of once per argument (#5588).\r\n- Fixes and improvements to the git completions, including printing correct paths with older git versions, fuzzy matching again, reducing unnecessary offers of root paths (starting with `:/`) (#5578, #5574, #5476), and ignoring shell aliases, so enterprising users can set up the wrapping command (via `set -g __fish_git_alias_$command $whatitwraps`) (#5412).\r\n- Significant performance improvements to core shell functions (#5447) and to the `kill` completions (#5541). \r\n- Starting in symbolically-linked working directories works correctly (#5525).\r\n- The default `fish_title` function no longer contains extra spaces (#5517).\r\n- The `nim` prompt now works correctly when chosen in the Web-based configuration (#5490).\r\n- `string` now prints help to stdout, like other builtins (#5495).\r\n- Killing the terminal while fish is in vi normal mode will no longer send it spinning and eating CPU. (#5528)\r\n- A number of crashes have been fixed (#5550, #5548, #5479, #5453).\r\n- Improvements to the documentation and certain completions.\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\n\r\nThere is one significant known issue that was not corrected before the release:\r\n\r\n- fish does not run correctly under Windows Services for Linux before Windows 10 version 1809/17763, and the message warning of this may not be displayed (#5619).\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 2.7.1 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.0.0 and 3.0b1.",

        "body": "fish 3 is a major release, which introduces some breaking changes alongside improved functionality. Although most existing scripts will continue to work, they should be reviewed against the list contained below.\r\n\r\n_Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-3.0.0.tar.gz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" may not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is ea9dd3614bb0346829ce7319437c6a93e3e1dfde3b7f6a469b543b0d2c68f2cf. A GPG signature from David Adam (0x7A67D962D88A709A) is available as \"fish-3.0.0.tar.gz.asc\"._\r\n\r\nCompared to the beta release of fish 3.0b1, fish version 3.0.0:\r\n\r\n- builds correctly against musl libc (#5407)\r\n- handles huge numeric arguments to `test` correctly (#5414)\r\n- removes the history colouring introduced in 3.0b1, which did not always work correctly\r\n\r\nThere is one significant known issue which was not able to be corrected before the release:\r\n\r\n- fish 3.0.0 builds on Cygwin (#5423), but does not run correctly (#5426) and will result in a hanging terminal when started. Cygwin users are encouraged to continue using 2.7.1 until a release which corrects this is available.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 2.7.1 or before, please also review the release notes for 3.0b1, which follow.\r\n\r\n## Notable non-backward compatible changes\r\n-  Process and job expansion has largely been removed. `%` will no longer perform these expansions, except for `%self` for the PID of the current shell. Additionally, job management commands (`disown`, `wait`, `bg`, `fg` and `kill`) will expand job specifiers starting with `%` (#4230, #1202).\r\n- `set x[1] x[2] a b`, to set multiple elements of an array at once, is no longer valid syntax (#4236).\r\n- A literal `{}` now expands to itself, rather than nothing. This makes working with `find -exec` easier (#1109, #4632).\r\n- Literally accessing a zero-index is now illegal syntax and is caught by the parser (#4862). (fish indices start at 1)\r\n- Successive commas in brace expansions are handled in less surprising manner. For example, `{,,,}` expands to four empty strings rather than an empty string, a comma and an empty string again (#3002, #4632).\r\n- `for` loop control variables are no longer local to the `for` block (#1935).\r\n- Variables set in `if` and `while` conditions are available outside the block (#4820).\r\n- Local exported (`set -lx`) vars are now visible to functions (#1091).\r\n- The new `math` builtin (see below) does not support logical expressions; `test` should be used instead (#4777).\r\n- Range expansion will now behave sensibly when given a single positive and negative index (`$foo[5..-1]` or `$foo[-1..5]`), clamping to the last valid index without changing direction if the list has fewer elements than expected.\r\n- `read` now uses `-s` as short for `--silent` (\u00e0 la `bash`); `--shell`'s abbreviation (formerly `-s`) is now `-S` instead (#4490).\r\n- `cd` no longer resolves symlinks. fish now maintains a virtual path, matching other shells (#3350).\r\n- `source` now requires an explicit `-` as the filename to read from the terminal (#2633).\r\n- Arguments to `end` are now errors, instead of being silently ignored.\r\n- The names `argparse`, `read`, `set`, `status`, `test` and `[` are now reserved and not allowed as function names. This prevents users unintentionally breaking stuff (#3000).\r\n- The `fish_user_abbreviations` variable is no longer used; abbreviations will be migrated to the new storage format automatically.\r\n- The `FISH_READ_BYTE_LIMIT` variable is now called `fish_byte_limit` (#4414).\r\n- Environment variables are no longer split into arrays based on the record separator character on startup. Instead, variables are not split, unless their name ends in PATH, in which case they are split on colons (#436).\r\n- The `history` builtin's `--with-time` option has been removed; this has been deprecated in favor of `--show-time` since 2.7.0 (#4403).\r\n- The internal variables `__fish_datadir` and `__fish_sysconfdir` are now known as `__fish_data_dir` and `__fish_sysconf_dir` respectively.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\nWith the release of fish 3, a number of features have been marked for removal in the future. All users are encouraged to explore alternatives. A small number of these features are currently behind feature flags, which are turned on at present but may be turned off by default in the future.\r\n\r\nA new feature flags mechanism is added for staging deprecations and breaking changes. Feature flags may be specified at launch with `fish --features ...` or by setting the universal `fish_features` variable. (#4940)\r\n\r\n- The use of the `IFS` variable for `read` is deprecated; `IFS` will be ignored in the future (#4156). Use the `read --delimiter` option instead.\r\n- The `function --on-process-exit` switch will be removed in future (#4700). Use the `fish_exit` event instead: `function --on-event fish_exit`.\r\n- `$_` is deprecated and will removed in the future (#813). Use `status current-command` in a command substitution instead.\r\n- `^` as a redirection deprecated and will be removed in the future. (#4394). Use `2>` to redirect stderr. This is controlled by the `stderr-nocaret` feature flag.\r\n- `?` as a glob (wildcard) is deprecated and will be removed in the future (#4520). This is controlled by the `qmark-noglob` feature flag.\r\n\r\n## Notable fixes and improvements\r\n### Syntax changes and new commands\r\n- fish now supports `&&` (like `and`), `||` (like `or`), and `!` (like `not`), for better migration from POSIX-compliant shells (#4620).\r\n- Variables may be used as commands (#154).\r\n- fish may be started in private mode via `fish --private`. Private mode fish sessions do not have access to the history file and any commands evaluated in private mode are not persisted for future sessions. A session variable `$fish_private_mode` can be queried to detect private mode and adjust the behavior of scripts accordingly to respect the user's wish for privacy.\r\n- A new `wait` command for waiting on backgrounded processes (#4498).\r\n- `math` is now a builtin rather than a wrapper around `bc` (#3157). Floating point computations is now used by default, and can be controlled with the new `--scale` option (#4478).\r\n- Setting `$PATH` no longer warns on non-existent directories, allowing for a single $PATH to be shared across machines (eg via dotfiles) (#2969).\r\n- `while` sets `$status` to a non-zero value if the loop is not executed (#4982).\r\n- Command substitution output is now limited to 10 MB by default, controlled by the `fish_read_limit` variable (#3822). Notably, this is larger than most operating systems' argument size limit, so trying to pass argument lists this size to external commands has never worked.\r\n- The machine hostname, where available, is now exposed as the `$hostname` reserved variable. This removes the dependency on the `hostname` executable (#4422).\r\n- Bare `bind` invocations in config.fish now work. The `fish_user_key_bindings` function is no longer necessary, but will still be executed if it exists (#5191).\r\n- `$fish_pid` and `$last_pid` are available as replacements for `%self` and `%last`.\r\n\r\n### New features in commands\r\n- `alias` has a new `--save` option to save the generated function immediately (#4878).\r\n- `bind` has a new `--silent` option to ignore bind requests for named keys not available under the current terminal (#4188, #4431).\r\n- `complete` has a new `--keep-order` option to show the provided or dynamically-generated argument list in the same order as specified, rather than alphabetically (#361).\r\n- `exec` prompts for confirmation if background jobs are running.\r\n- `funced` has a new `--save` option to automatically save the edited function after successfully editing (#4668).\r\n- `functions` has a new ` --handlers` option to show functions registered as event handlers (#4694).\r\n- `history search` supports globs for wildcard searching (#3136) and has a new `--reverse` option to show entries from oldest to newest (#4375).\r\n- `jobs` has a new `--quiet` option to silence the output.\r\n- `read` has a new `--delimiter` option for splitting input into arrays (#4256).\r\n- `read` writes directly to stdout if called without arguments (#4407).\r\n- `read` can now read individual lines into separate variables without consuming the input in its entirety via the new `/--line` option.\r\n- `set` has new `--append` and `--prepend` options (#1326).\r\n- `set` has a new `--show` option to show lots of information about variables (#4265).\r\n- `string match` with an empty pattern and `--entire` in glob mode now matches everything instead of nothing (#4971).\r\n- `string split` supports a new `--no-empty` option to exclude empty strings from the result (#4779).\r\n- `string` has new subcommands `split0` and `join0` for working with NUL-delimited output.\r\n- `string` no longer stops processing text after NUL characters (#4605)\r\n- `string escape` has a new `--style regex` option for escaping strings to be matched literally in `string` regex operations.\r\n- `test` now supports floating point values in numeric comparisons.\r\n\r\n### Interactive improvements\r\n- A pipe at the end of a line now allows the job to continue on the next line (#1285).\r\n- Italics and dim support out of the box on macOS for Terminal.app and iTerm (#4436).\r\n- `cd` tab completions no longer descend into the deepest unambiguous path (#4649).\r\n- Pager navigation has been improved. Most notably, moving down now wraps around, moving up from the commandline now jumps to the last element and moving right and left now reverse each other even when wrapping around (#4680).\r\n- Typing normal characters while the completion pager is active no longer shows the search field. Instead it enters them into the command line, and ends paging (#2249).\r\n- A new input binding `pager-toggle-search` toggles the search field in the completions pager on and off. By default, this is bound to Ctrl-S.\r\n- Searching in the pager now does a full fuzzy search (#5213).\r\n- The pager will now show the full command instead of just its last line if the number of completions is large (#4702).\r\n- Abbreviations can be tab-completed (#3233).\r\n- Tildes in file names are now properly escaped in completions (#2274).\r\n- Wrapping completions (from `complete --wraps` or `function --wraps`) can now inject arguments. For example, `complete gco --wraps 'git checkout'` now works properly (#1976). The `alias` function has been updated to respect this behavior.\r\n- Path completions now support expansions, meaning expressions like `python ~/<TAB>` now provides file suggestions just like any other relative or absolute path. (This includes support for other expansions, too.)\r\n- Autosuggestions try to avoid arguments that are already present in the command line.\r\n- Notifications about crashed processes are now always shown, even in command substitutions (#4962).\r\n- The screen is no longer reset after a BEL, fixing graphical glitches (#3693).\r\n- vi-mode now supports ';' and ',' motions. This introduces new {forward,backward}-jump-till and repeat-jump{,-reverse} bind functions (#5140).\r\n- The `*y` vi-mode binding now works (#5100).\r\n- True color is now enabled in neovim by default (#2792).\r\n- Terminal size variables (`$COLUMNS`/`$LINES`) are now updated before `fish_prompt` is called, allowing the prompt to react (#904).\r\n- Multi-line prompts no longer repeat when the terminal is resized (#2320).\r\n- `xclip` support has been added to the clipboard integration (#5020).\r\n- The Alt-P keybinding paginates the last command if the command line is empty.\r\n- `$cmd_duration` is no longer reset when no command is executed (#5011).\r\n- Deleting a one-character word no longer erases the next word as well (#4747).\r\n- Token history search (Alt-Up) omits duplicate entries (#4795).\r\n- The `fish_escape_delay_ms` timeout, allowing the use of the escape key both on its own and as part of a control sequence, was applied to all control characters; this has been reduced to just the escape key.\r\n- Completing a function shows the description properly (#5206).\r\n- Added completions for\r\n  - `ansible`, including `ansible-galaxy`, `ansible-playbook` and `ansible-vault` (#4697)\r\n  - `bb-power` (#4800)\r\n  - `bd` (#4472)\r\n  - `bower`\r\n  - `clang` and `clang++` (#4174)\r\n  - `conda` (#4837)\r\n  - `configure` (for autoconf-generated files only)\r\n  - `curl`\r\n  - `doas` (#5196)\r\n  - `ebuild` (#4911)\r\n  - `emaint` (#4758)\r\n  - `eopkg` (#4600)\r\n  - `exercism` (#4495)\r\n  - `hjson`\r\n  - `hugo` (#4529)\r\n  - `j` (from autojump #4344)\r\n  - `jbake` (#4814)\r\n  - `jhipster` (#4472)\r\n  - `kitty`\r\n  - `kldload`\r\n  - `kldunload`\r\n  - `makensis` (#5242)\r\n  - `meson`\r\n  - `mkdocs` (#4906)\r\n  - `ngrok` (#4642)\r\n  - OpenBSD's `pkg_add`, `pkg_delete`, `pkg_info`, `pfctl`, `rcctl`, `signify`, and `vmctl` (#4584)\r\n  - `openocd`\r\n  - `optipng`\r\n  - `opkg` (#5168)\r\n  - `pandoc` (#2937)\r\n  - `port` (#4737)\r\n  - `powerpill` (#4800)\r\n  - `pstack` (#5135)\r\n  - `serve` (#5026)\r\n  - `ttx`\r\n  - `unzip`\r\n  - `virsh` (#5113)\r\n  - `xclip` (#5126)\r\n  - `xsv`\r\n  - `zfs` and `zpool` (#4608)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions (especially `darcs` (#5112), `git`, `hg` and `sudo`).\r\n- Completions for `yarn` and `npm` now require the `all-the-package-names` NPM package for full functionality.\r\n- Completions for `bower` and `yarn` now require the `jq` utility for full functionality.\r\n- Improved French translations.\r\n\r\n### Other fixes and improvements\r\n- Significant performance improvements to `abbr` (#4048), setting variables (#4200, #4341), executing functions, globs (#4579), `string` reading from standard input (#4610), and slicing history (in particular, `$history[1]` for the last executed command).\r\n- Fish's internal wcwidth function has been updated to deal with newer Unicode, and the width of some characters can be configured via the `fish_ambiguous_width` (#5149) and `fish_emoji_width` (#2652) variables. Alternatively, a new build-time option INTERNAL_WCWIDTH can be used to use the system's wcwidth instead (#4816).\r\n- `functions` correctly supports `-d` as the short form of `--description`. (#5105)\r\n- `/etc/paths` is now parsed like macOS' bash `path_helper`, fixing $PATH order (#4336, #4852) on macOS.\r\n- Using a read-only variable in a `for` loop produces an error, rather than silently producing incorrect results (#4342).\r\n- The universal variables filename no longer contains the hostname or MAC address. It is now at the fixed location `.config/fish/fish_variables` (#1912).\r\n- Exported variables in the global or universal scope no longer have their exported status affected by local variables (#2611).\r\n- Major rework of terminal and job handling to eliminate bugs (#3805, #3952, #4178, #4235, #4238, #4540, #4929, #5210).\r\n- Improvements to the manual page completion generator (#2937, #4313).\r\n- `suspend --force` now works correctly (#4672).\r\n- Pressing Ctrl-C while running a script now reliably terminates fish (#5253).\r\n\r\n### For distributors and developers\r\n- fish ships with a new build system based on CMake. CMake 3.2 is the minimum required version. Although the autotools-based Makefile and the Xcode project are still shipped with this release, they will be removed in the near future. All distributors and developers are encouraged to migrate to the CMake build.\r\n- Build scripts for most platforms no longer require bash, using the standard sh instead.\r\n- The `hostname` command is no longer required for fish to operate.\r\n",

This also includes the `fish_opt` helper command. (#4190).\r\n- Invalid array indexes are now silently ignored (#826, #4127).\r\n- Improvements to the debugging facility, including a prompt specific to the debugger (`fish_breakpoint_prompt`) and a `status is-breakpoint` subcommand (#1310).\r\n- `string` supports new `lower` and `upper` subcommands, for altering the case of strings (#4080). The case changing is not locale-aware yet.\r\n- `string escape` has a new `--style=xxx` flag where `xxx` can be `script`, `var`, or `url` (#4150), and can be reversed with `string unescape` (#3543).\r\n- History can now be split into sessions with the `fish_history` variable, or not saved to disk at all (#102).\r\n- Read history is now controlled by the `fish_history` variable rather than the `--mode-name` flag (#1504).\r\n- `command` now supports an `--all` flag to report all directories with the command. `which` is no longer a runtime dependency (#2778).\r\n- fish can run commands before starting an interactive session using the new `--init-command`/`-C` options (#4164).\r\n- `set` has a new `--show` option to show lots of information about variables (#4265).\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes\r\n- The `COLUMNS` and `LINES` environment variables are now correctly set the first time `fish_prompt` is run (#4141).\r\n- `complete`'s `--no-files` option works as intended (#112).\r\n- `echo -h` now correctly echoes `-h` in line with other shells (#4120).\r\n- The `export` compatibility function now returns zero on success, rather than always returning 1 (#4435).\r\n- Stop converting empty elements in MANPATH to \".\" (#4158). The behavior being changed was introduced in fish 2.6.0.\r\n- `count -h` and `count --help` now return 1 rather than produce command help output (#4189).\r\n- An attempt to `read` which stops because too much data is available still defines the variables given as parameters (#4180).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.4.0 which prevented `pushd +1` from working has been fixed (#4091).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.6.0 where multiple `read` commands in non-interactive scripts were broken has been fixed (#4206).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.6.0 involving universal variables with side-effects at startup such as `set -U fish_escape_delay_ms 10` has been fixed (#4196).\r\n- Added completions for:\r\n  - `as` (#4130)\r\n  - `cdh` (#2847)\r\n  - `dhcpd` (#4115)\r\n  - `ezjail-admin` (#4324)\r\n  - Fabric's `fab` (#4153)\r\n  - `grub-file` (#4119)\r\n  - `grub-install` (#4119)\r\n  - `jest` (#4142)\r\n  - `kdeconnect-cli`\r\n  - `magneto` (#4043, #4108)\r\n  - `mdadm` (#4198)\r\n  - `passwd` (#4209)\r\n  - `pip` and `pipenv` (#4448)\r\n  - `s3cmd` (#4332)\r\n  - `sbt` (#4347)\r\n  - `snap` (#4215)\r\n  - Sublime Text 3's `subl` (#4277)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions.\r\n- Updated Chinese and French translations.",

        "body": "\r\nThere are no major changes between 2.7b1 and 2.7.0. If you are upgrading from version 2.6.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 2.7b1 (included below).\r\n\r\nXcode builds and macOS packages could not be produced with 2.7b1, but this is fixed in 2.7.0.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe release notes for fish 2.7b1 are as follows:\r\n\r\n## Notable improvements\r\n- A new `cdh` (change directory using recent history) command provides a more friendly alternative to prevd/nextd and pushd/popd (#2847).\r\n- A new `argparse` command is available to allow fish script to parse arguments with the same behavior as builtin commands. This also includes the `fish_opt` helper command. (#4190).\r\n- Invalid array indexes are now silently ignored (#826, #4127).\r\n- Improvements to the debugging facility, including a prompt specific to the debugger (`fish_breakpoint_prompt`) and a `status is-breakpoint` subcommand (#1310).\r\n- `string` supports new `lower` and `upper` subcommands, for altering the case of strings (#4080). The case changing is not locale-aware yet.\r\n- `string escape` has a new `--style=xxx` flag where `xxx` can be `script`, `var`, or `url` (#4150), and can be reversed with `string unescape` (#3543).\r\n- History can now be split into sessions with the `fish_history` variable, or not saved to disk at all (#102).\r\n- Read history is now controlled by the `fish_history` variable rather than the `--mode-name` flag (#1504).\r\n- `command` now supports an `--all` flag to report all directories with the command. `which` is no longer a runtime dependency (#2778).\r\n- fish can run commands before starting an interactive session using the new `--init-command`/`-C` options (#4164).\r\n- `set` has a new `--show` option to show lots of information about variables (#4265).\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes\r\n- The `COLUMNS` and `LINES` environment variables are now correctly set the first time `fish_prompt` is run (#4141).\r\n- `complete`'s `--no-files` option works as intended (#112).\r\n- `echo -h` now correctly echoes `-h` in line with other shells (#4120).\r\n- The `export` compatibility function now returns zero on success, rather than always returning 1 (#4435).\r\n- Stop converting empty elements in MANPATH to \".\" (#4158). The behavior being changed was introduced in fish 2.6.0.\r\n- `count -h` and `count --help` now return 1 rather than produce command help output (#4189).\r\n- An attempt to `read` which stops because too much data is available still defines the variables given as parameters (#4180).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.4.0 which prevented `pushd +1` from working has been fixed (#4091).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.6.0 where multiple `read` commands in non-interactive scripts were broken has been fixed (#4206).\r\n- A regression in fish 2.6.0 involving universal variables with side-effects at startup such as `set -U fish_escape_delay_ms 10` has been fixed (#4196).\r\n- Added completions for:\r\n  - `as` (#4130)\r\n  - `cdh` (#2847)\r\n  - `dhcpd` (#4115)\r\n  - `ezjail-admin` (#4324)\r\n  - Fabric's `fab` (#4153)\r\n  - `grub-file` (#4119)\r\n  - `grub-install` (#4119)\r\n  - `jest` (#4142)\r\n  - `kdeconnect-cli`\r\n  - `magneto` (#4043, #4108)\r\n  - `mdadm` (#4198)\r\n  - `passwd` (#4209)\r\n  - `pip` and `pipenv` (#4448)\r\n  - `s3cmd` (#4332)\r\n  - `sbt` (#4347)\r\n  - `snap` (#4215)\r\n  - Sublime Text 3's `subl` (#4277)\r\n- Lots of improvements to completions.\r\n- Updated Chinese and French translations.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDownload links:\r\nTo download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-2.7.0.tar.gz\".

        "body": "Since the beta release of fish 2.6b1, fish version 2.6.0 contains a number of minor fixes, new completions for `magneto` (#4043), and improvements to the documentation.\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\n- Apple macOS Sierra 10.12.5 introduced a problem with launching web browsers from other programs using AppleScript. This affects the fish Web configuration (`fish_config`); users on these platforms will need to manually open the address displayed in the terminal, such as by copying and pasting it into a browser. This problem will be fixed with macOS 10.12.6.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading from version 2.5.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 2.6b1 (included below).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe release notes for fish 2.6b1 are as follows:\r\n\r\n## Notable fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n- Jobs running in the background can now be removed from the list of jobs with the new `disown` builtin, which behaves like the same command in other shells (#2810).\r\n- Command substitutions now have access to the terminal, like in other shells. This allows tools like `fzf` to work properly (#1362, #3922).\r\n- In cases where the operating system does not report the size of the terminal, the `COLUMNS` and `LINES` environment variables are used; if they are unset, a default of 80x24 is assumed.\r\n- New French (#3772 & #3788) and improved German (#3834) translations.\r\n- fish no longer depends on the `which` external command.\r\n\r\n## Other significant changes\r\n\r\n- Performance improvements in launching processes, including major reductions in signal blocking. Although this has been heavily tested, it may cause problems in some circumstances; set the `FISH_NO_SIGNAL_BLOCK` variable to 0 in your fish configuration file to return to the old behaviour (#2007).\r\n- Performance improvements in prompts and functions that set lots of colours (#3793).\r\n- The Delete key no longer deletes backwards (a regression in 2.5.0).\r\n- `functions` supports a new `--details` option, which identifies where the function was loaded from (#3295), and a `--details --verbose` option which includes the function description (#597).\r\n- `read` will read up to 10 MiB by default, leaving the target variable empty and exiting with status 122 if the line is too long. You can set a different limit with the `FISH_READ_BYTE_LIMIT` variable.\r\n- `read` supports a new `--silent` option to hide the characters typed (#838), for when reading sensitive data from the terminal. `read` also now accepts simple strings for the prompt (rather than scripts) with the new `-P` and `--prompt-str` options (#802).\r\n- `export` and `setenv` now understand colon-separated `PATH`, `CDPATH` and `MANPATH` variables.\r\n- `bind` supports a new `--list-modes` option (#3872).\r\n- `bg` will check all of its arguments before backgrounding any jobs; any invalid arguments will cause a failure, but non-existent (eg recently exited) jobs are ignored (#3909).\r\n- `funced` warns if the function being edited has not been modified (#3961).\r\n- `printf` correctly outputs \"long long\" integers (#3352).\r\n- `status` supports a new `current-function` subcommand to print the current function name (#1743).\r\n- `string` supports a new `repeat` subcommand (#3864). `string match` supports a new `--entire` option to emit the entire line matched by a pattern (#3957). `string replace` supports a new `--filter` option to only emit lines which underwent a replacement (#3348).\r\n- `test` supports the `-k` option to test for sticky bits (#733).\r\n- `umask` understands symbolic modes (#738). \r\n- Empty components in the `CDPATH`, `MANPATH` and `PATH` variables are now converted to \".\" (#2106, #3914).\r\n- New versions of ncurses (6.0 and up) wipe terminal scrollback buffers with certain commands; the `C-l` binding tries to avoid this (#2855).\r\n- Some systems' `su` implementations do not set the `USER` environment variable; it is now reset for root users (#3916).\r\n- Under terminals which support it, bracketed paste is enabled, escaping problematic characters for security and convience (#3871). Inside single quotes (`'`), single quotes and backslashes in pasted text are escaped (#967). The `fish_clipboard_paste` function (bound to `C-v` by default) is still the recommended pasting method where possible as it includes this functionality and more.\r\n- Processes in pipelines are no longer signalled as soon as one command in the pipeline has completed (#1926). This behaviour matches other shells mre closely.\r\n- All functions requiring Python work with whichever version of Python is installed (#3970). Python 3 is preferred, but Python 2.6 remains the minimum version required.\r\n- The color of the cancellation character can be controlled by the `fish_color_cancel` variable (#3963).\r\n- Added completions for:\r\n - `caddy` (#4008)\r\n - `castnow` (#3744)\r\n - `climate` (#3760)\r\n - `flatpak`\r\n - `gradle` (#3859)\r\n - `gsettings` (#4001)\r\n - `helm` (#3829)\r\n - `i3-msg` (#3787)\r\n - `ipset` (#3924)\r\n - `jq` (#3804)\r\n - `light` (#3752)\r\n - `minikube` (#3778)\r\n - `mocha` (#3828)\r\n - `mkdosfs` (#4017)\r\n - `pv` (#3773)\r\n - `setsid` (#3791)\r\n - `terraform` (#3960)\r\n - `usermod` (#3775)\r\n - `xinput`\r\n - `yarn` (#3816)\r\n- Improved completions for `adb` (#3853), `apt` (#3771), `bzr` (#3769), `dconf`, `git` (including #3743), `grep` (#3789), `go` (#3789), `help` (#3789), `hg` (#3975), `htop` (#3789), `killall` (#3996), `lua`, `man` (#3762), `mount` (#3764 & #3841), `obnam` (#3924), `perl` (#3856), `portmaster` (#3950), `python` (#3840), `ssh` (#3781), `scp` (#3781), `systemctl` (#3757) and `udisks` (#3764).\r\n\r\nDownload links:\r\nTo download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-2.6.0.tar.gz\".

        "body": "There are no major changes between 2.5b1 and 2.5.0. If you are upgrading from version 2.4.0 or before, please also review the release notes for 2.5b1 (included below).\n\n## Notable fixes and improvements\n- The Home, End, Insert, Delete, Page Up and Page Down keys work in Vi-style key bindings (#3731).\n\n---\n\nThe release notes for fish 2.5b1 are as follows:\n\n## Platform Changes\n\nStarting with version 2.5, fish requires a more up-to-date version of C++, specifically C++11 (from 2011). This affects some older platforms:\n\n### Linux\n\nFor users building from source, GCC's g++ 4.8 or later, or LLVM's clang 3.3 or later, are known to work. Older platforms may require a newer compiler installed.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the complexity of the toolchain, binary packages are no longer published by the fish-shell developers for the following platforms:\n- Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS 5 & 6 for 64-bit builds\n- Ubuntu 12.04 (EoLTS April 2017)\n- Debian 7 (EoLTS May 2018)\n\nInstalling newer version of fish on these systems will require building from source.\n\n### OS X SnowLeopard\n\nStarting with version 2.5, fish requires a C++11 standard library on OS X 10.6 (\"SnowLeopard\"). If this library is not installed, you will see this error: `dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib`\n\nMacPorts is the easiest way to obtain this library. After installing the SnowLeopard MacPorts release from the install page, run:\n\n```\nsudo port -v install libcxx\n```\n\nNow fish should launch successfully. (Please open an issue if it does not.)\n\nThis is only necessary on 10.6. OS X 10.7 and later include the required library by default.\n\n## Other significant changes\n- Attempting to exit with running processes in the background produces a warning, then signals them to terminate if a second attempt to exit is made. This brings the behaviour for running background processes into line with stopped processes. (#3497)\n- `random` can now have start, stop and step values specified, or the new `choice` subcommand can be used to pick an argument from a list (#3619).\n- A new key bindings preset, `fish_hybrid_key_bindings`, including all the Emacs-style and Vi-style bindings, which behaves like `fish_vi_key_bindings` in fish 2.3.0 (#3556).\n- `function` now returns an error when called with invalid options, rather than defining the function anyway (#3574). This was a regression present in fish 2.3 and 2.4.0.\n- fish no longer prints a warning when it identifies a running instance of an old version (2.1.0 and earlier). Changes to universal variables may not propagate between these old versions and 2.5b1.\n- Improved compatiblity with Android (#3585), MSYS/mingw (#2360), Solaris (#3456, #3340)\n- Like other shells, the `test` builting now returns an error for numeric operations on invalid integers (#3346, #3581).\n- `complete` no longer recognises `--authoritative` and `--unauthoritative` options, and they are marked as obsolete.\n- `status` accepts subcommands, and should be used like `status is-interactive`. The old options continue to be supported for the foreseeable future (#3526), although only one subcommand or option can be specified at a time.\n- Selection mode (used with \"begin-selection\") no longer selects a character the cursor does not move over (#3684).\n- List indexes are handled better, and a bit more liberally in some cases (`echo $PATH[1 .. 3]` is now valid) (#3579).\n- The `fish_mode_prompt` function is now simply a stub around `fish_default_mode_prompt`, which allows the mode prompt to be included more easily in customised prompt functions (#3641).\n\n## Notable fixes and improvements\n- `alias`, run without options or arguments, lists all defined aliases, and aliases now include a description in the function signature that identifies them.\n- `complete` accepts empty strings as descriptions (#3557).\n- `command` accepts `-q`/`--quiet` in combination with `--search` (#3591), providing a simple way of checking whether a command exists in scripts.\n- Abbreviations can now be renamed with `abbr --rename OLD_KEY NEW_KEY` (#3610).\n- The command synopses printed by `--help` options work better with copying and pasting (#2673).\n- `help` launches the browser specified by the `$fish_help_browser variable` if it is set (#3131).\n- History merging could lose items under certain circumstances and is now fixed (#3496).\n- The `$status` variable is now set to 123 when a syntactically invalid command is entered (#3616).\n- Exiting fish now signals all background processes to terminate, not just stopped jobs (#3497).\n- A new `prompt_hostname` function which prints a hostname suitable for use in prompts (#3482).\n- The `__fish_man_page` function (bound to Alt-h by default) now tries to recognize subcommands (e.g. `git add` will now open the \"git-add\" man page) (#3678).\n- A new function `edit_command_buffer` (bound to Alt-e & Alt-v by default) to edit the command buffer in an external editor (#1215, #3627).\n- `set_color` now supports italics (`--italics`), dim (`--dim`) and reverse (`--reverse`) modes (#3650).\n- Filesystems with very slow locking (eg incorrectly-configured NFS) will no longer slow fish down (#685).\n- Improved completions for `apt` (#3695), `fusermount` (#3642), `make` (#3628), `netctl-auto` (#3378), `nmcli` (#3648), `pygmentize` (#3378), and `tar` (#3719).\n- Added completions for:\n  - `VBoxHeadless` (#3378)\n  - `VBoxSDL` (#3378)\n  - `base64` (#3378)\n  - `caffeinate` (#3524)\n  - `dconf` (#3638)\n  - `dig` (#3495)\n  - `dpkg-reconfigure` (#3521 & #3522)\n  - `feh` (#3378)\n  - `launchctl` (#3682)\n  - `lxc` (#3554 & #3564),\n  - `mddiagnose` (#3524)\n  - `mdfind` (#3524)\n  - `mdimport`  (#3524)\n  - `mdls` (#3524)\n  - `mdutil` (#3524)\n  - `mkvextract` (#3492)\n  - `nvram` (#3524)\n  - `objdump` (#3378)\n  - `sysbench` (#3491)\n  - `tmutil` (#3524)\n\nDownload links: to download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named \"fish-2.5.0.tar.gz\". The file downloaded from \"Source code (tar.gz)\" will not build correctly.\n",

This release does not contain all the changes to fish since the last release, but fixes a number of issues directly affecting users at present and includes a small number of new features.\n\n## Significant changes\n- A new `fish_key_reader` binary for decoding interactive keypresses (#2991).\n- `fish_mode_prompt` has been updated to reflect the changes in the way the Vi input mode is set up (#3067), making this more reliable.\n- `fish_config` can now properly be launched from the OS X app bundle (#3140).\n\n## Notable fixes and improvements\n- Extra lines were sometimes inserted into the output under Windows (Cygwin and Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux) due to TTY timestamps not being updated (#2859).\n- The `string` builtin's `match` mode now handles the combination of `-rnv` (match, invert and count) correctly (#3098).\n- Improvements to TTY special character handling (#3064), locale handling (#3124) and terminal environment variable handling (#3060).\n- Work towards handling the terminal modes for external commands launched from initialisation files (#2980).\n- Ease the upgrade path from fish 2.2.0 and before by warning users to restart fish if the `string` builtin is not available (#3057).\n- `type -a` now syntax-colorizes function source output.\n- Added completions for `alsamixer`, `godoc`, `gofmt`, `goimports`, `gorename`, `lscpu`, `mkdir`, `modinfo`, `netctl-auto`, `poweroff`, `termite`, `udisksctl` and `xz` (#3123).\n- Improved completions for `apt` (#3097), `aura` (#3102),`git` (#3114), `npm` (#3158), `string` and `suspend` (#3154).\n- Improved completion of hostnames via ssh_config (#3146), used for numerous commands (ssh, rsync, svn, systemd tools, ...)\n",

This builtin will measure, split, search and replace text strings, including using regular expressions. It can also be used to turn lists into plain strings using `join`. `string` can be used in place of `sed`, `grep`, `tr`, `cut`, and `awk` in many situations. (#2296)\n- After seeing an escape character wait up to 300ms for an additional character. This is consistent with readline (e.g. bash) and can be configured via the fish_escape_delay_ms variable. This allows using escape as the Meta modifier. (#1356)\n- Add new directories for vendor functions and configuration snippets (#2498)\n- A new `fish_realpath` builtin and associated function to allow the use of `realpath` even on those platforms that don't ship an appropriate command (#2932).\n- Alt-# toggles the current command line between commented and uncommented states, making it easy to save a command in history without executing it.\n- The `fish_vi_mode` function is now deprecated in favour of `fish_vi_key_bindings`.\n\n## Backward-incompatible changes<a id=\"sec-2\" name=\"sec-2\"></a>\n-   Unmatched globs will now cause an error, except when used with `for`, `set` or `count` (#2719, #2394)\n-   `and` and `or` will now bind to the closest `if` or `while`, allowing compound conditions without `begin` and `end` (#1428)\n-   `set -ql` now searches up to function scope for variables (#2502)\n-   `status -f` will now behave the same when run as the main script or using `source` (#2643)\n-   `source` no longer puts the file name in `$argv` if no arguments are given (#139)\n\n## Other notable fixes and improvements<a id=\"sec-3\" name=\"sec-3\"></a>\n-   Fish no longer silences errors in config.fish (#2702)\n-   Move the history file to $XDG_DATA_HOME/fish (or ~/.local/share if it has not been set)\n-   Directory autosuggestions will now descend as far as possible if there is only one child directory (#2531)\n-   Add support for bright colors (#1464)\n-   Allow Ctrl-J (\\cj) to be bound separately from Ctrl-M (\\cm) (#217)\n-   psub now has a \"-s\"/\"&#x2013;suffix\" option to name the temporary file with that suffix\n-   Enable 24-bit colors on select terminals (#2495)\n-   Support for SVN status in the prompt (#2582)\n-   Mercurial and SVN support have been added to the Classic + Git (now Classic + VCS) prompt (via the new __fish_vcs_prompt function) (#2592)\n-   export now handles variables with a \"=\" in the value (#2403)\n-   Avoid confusing the terminal line driver with non-printing characters in `fish_title` (#2453).\n-   New completions for:\n  -   alsactl\n  -   Archlinux's asp, makepkg\n  -   Atom's apm (#2390)\n  -   entr - the \"Event Notify Test Runner\" (#2265)\n  -   Fedora's dnf (#2638)\n  -   OSX diskutil (#2738)\n  -   pkgng (#2395)\n  -   pulseaudio's pacmd and pactl\n  -   rmmod (#3007)\n  -   rust's rustc and cargo (#2409)\n  -   sysctl (#2214)\n  -   systemd's machinectl (#2158), busctl (#2144), systemd-nspawn, systemd-analyze, localectl, timedatectl\n  -   and more\n-   Fish no longer has a function called sgrep, freeing it for user customization (#2245)\n-   A rewrite of the completions for cd, fixing a few bugs (#2299, #2300, #562)\n-   Linux VTs now run in a simplified mode to avoid issues (#2311)\n-   The vi-bindings now inherit from the emacs bindings\n-   Fish will also execute fish_user_key_bindings when in vi-mode\n-   `funced` will now also check $VISUAL (#2268)\n-   A new `suspend` function (#2269)\n-   Subcommand completion now works better with split /usr (#2141)\n-   The command-not-found-handler can now be overridden by defining a function called __fish_command_not_found_handler in config.fish (#2331)\n-   A few fixes to the Sorin theme\n-   PWD shortening in the prompt can now be configured via the fish_prompt_pwd_dir_length variable, set to the length per path component (#2473)\n-   fish now ships a skeleton file for /etc/fish/config.fish that only contains some documentation, the included code has been moved to the corresponding file in /usr (#2799)\n",
